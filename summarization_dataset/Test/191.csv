Okay, that person is going to fire Okay, they're gonna hit me from behind. I'm just really anxious. I'm driving about all are sitting on I'm in school and tests, I get really anxious. I take a test, I mean I know lot of information and I sit down and take the test and it's like I can't I can't recall because I'm so anxious about this test even though there",story,191_5,P,id,
was anything physical thought there?,routine,191_6,T,irq,

Do you remember what thoughts going on?,routine,191_8,T,irq,
"Um, my thoughts are like, I'm in the car. I'm gonna get hit. If I'm taking a test, it's like, Okay, I gotta do well on this test. I gotta remember this, there's so much to remember, and I just kind of brings freezing a little bit and I'm panicking because I can't remember. So I guess. So have you found that? No problem, which was not being able to complete the task?",story,191_9,P,id,
Four is it worth once you go through?,routine,191_10,T,irq,
"Um, is it like anxiety over when I finished the test? Yeah, yeah, after I'm finished. I mean, I know I could do perform better if I was going because I knew it wouldn't take me as long if I wasn't anxious. Um, it seems to me like time tests and so when it's over, whether it's an hour or two hours or however long it is, maybe it's over. You know, I'm anxious during it but when it's over. Yeah, it kind of subsides just like in car Like when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seemed to subside. So when the situation is over, it seems to seems to go down. ",symp/reasoning,191_11,P,id,
So sounds like you might need to find something that helps.,routine,191_12,T,od,
"Yeah, I also think that the time, tell me in the moment because these are things that I mean, I can't avoid. I mean, even in my job to I've got to go my field placement.

"No just lectricity grounding, you know that third floor thing, that's only grounding I know. I need to be grounded. That sounds good. Bring it on",symp/reasoning,191_17,P,on,
"So with grounding, a lot of people have a lot of emotions, okay to have emotions, but for some people, it gets really intense like, a lot and no one wants to bring that down to more of a calm place. So it doesn't necessarily solve the problem like there's still traffic. Yeah, nothing's going on, which just helps you get to a place to deal with",routine,191_18,T,cd,
That sounds good.,inactive,191_19,P,gc,
"So I'm going to introduce a grounding technique to you, okay, and involves some deeper events in closing the eyes and getting to your senses. Okay, so I have a little script. Okay",routine,191_20,T,gc,
okay. Okay.,inactive,191_21,P,gc,

",routine,191_24,T,gc,

" just totally okay, a lot of sense right now in this room is for smelling bad or good it's just normal Yeah, no any smelly smells nice no air.",symp/reasoning,191_31,P,id,

"Yeah, when he first came here Did you notice ?",routine,191_34,T,irq,
"mean, I might have noticed some of it but I'm obviously more aware because I'm really focusing on it right now. So I'm more aware of it right now.",symp/reasoning,191_35,P,id,
"And so maxwidth taste Notice I can just tell you some other situation you can take the time to like snack or something. Talk about the taste the texture. Well, it's totally the food and feel. Okay?",routine,191_36,T,gc,

"It was solid or solid soft rubber or anything like that secure like okay, it's it's gonna hold me. That's good feeling comfortable just comfortable.",symp/reasoning,191_45,P,id,
"So what we're just able to just went through each of the senses as a way of a bit of extraction from here. This also can be called a lying down to the details and then something else at the end, you can say, So, how does that feel?",routine,191_46,T,irq,
"Well, wow. He kind of did calm me down. I mean, I was kind of getting anxious telling you what made me anxious. And so I was kind of revved up, and then I kind of forgot about it, because I was focusing on you know, what I was seeing and what I was feeling and when I was, you know, all my senses of so it was very distracting. Damon a good way I got my mind off of that, and kind of got me on to something else. And then, yeah, they really did cut me down.",symp/reasoning,191_47,P,id,
Was there a certain sense that you weren't most help?,routine,191_48,T,irq,

"Well, it's good idea was wasn't in the MPR and sometimes that's good sometimes that's not good you know don't necessarily call me down sometimes I can get so I should probably I could I can listen to some more soothing music. Something that calms me down more also.",symp/reasoning,191_55,P,id,
"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,191_56,T,ack,
"Yeah, yeah, I think the music might be more because not that I want to be distracted from the cars. But I think my music might call me down more than having nothing, you know, like, quiet and hearing the cars growth might I can see That might make me nervous. I need to be aware of them. But I think I want to hear music. So I'll try that. Yeah.",symp/reasoning,191_57,P,id,
"Yeah, I'm focusing on the car in front of you",routine,191_58,T,gc,
"Yeah. Yeah. Not necessarily one behind me that might hit me too much for that. So okay. Okay, now",symp/reasoning,191_59,P,gc,
