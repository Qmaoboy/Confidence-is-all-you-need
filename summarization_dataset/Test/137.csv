And that's exactly what I did.",story,137_9,P,id,0
"So here you are. You're an honor student, your star athlete, you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years. And maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first, but now you're already noticing some consequence",routine,137_10,T,ack,0
right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.,routine,137_11,P,gc,-1
Ahhh hmmm.,inactive,137_12,T,ack,0
"Really, I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere, especially on the way weekends where instead of instead of studying, I'm caught up with my friends trying to find where we can get alcohol based on their age and, and stuff like that. ",symp/reasoning,137_13,P,id,0
It has really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?,routine,137_14,T,ack,0
" I don't know it. It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not well, not when I'm doing sports, but like, like a social environment, I tend to keep to myself. Because I'm very self conscious, I would say and when I drink, I feel like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. And it's just.",routine,137_15,P,id,-1
"So, it helps you kind of  loosen up feel more relaxed. ",routine,137_16,T,crq,0

"So your your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now",routine,137_20,T,crq,0

hmm hmm.,inactive,137_22,T,ack,0
" So since then, I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them. But I could also see that on just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before, as they are there for me. Yeah. ",story,137_23,P,cd,0
"Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying and it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here? ",routine,137_24,T,ack,0

Yeah,inactive,137_26,T,ack,0

Umm,inactive,137_28,T,gc,0
"That's, that's not worth it either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little or, like as it may seem to the other people like to me that it's a big thing.",routine,137_29,P,id,-1

Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?,routine,137_36,T,crq,0
