Afternoon. I'm glad you could get in today.,inactive,39_0,T,gt,
I'm still anxious.,symp/reasoning,39_1,P,gt,
"Yes, last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety, and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety. And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee. You were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature. So I'm wondering how all that went?",routine,39_2,T,irq,
"Well, I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes, so I didn't I didn't really do that. I did cut back on my coffee a little bit, but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning. So, you know, I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups. And I did take the dog for a walk. But I haven't really gotten out other than that.",symp/reasoning,39_3,P,id,
"Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue. Getting out more with people.",routine,39_4,T,gc,
"Yeah, I don't. I don't really like to go out with people. There's usually a lot of a lot of chatter, a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in.",story,39_5,P,gc,
"So it's uncomfortable for you to be To around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking, and how does that make you feel?",routine,39_6,T,irq,
"It just makes me feel a little bit nervous. And then when I get out there, I don't really, I don't really engage in conversation.",story,39_7,P,id,
"Okay, so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. So I'm wondering what we could do about that.",routine,39_8,T,irq,
I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead.,routine,39_9,P,id,
"That would absolutely be one option. You could invite people over to your house, and then you could get to choose who you're around.",routine,39_10,T,od,
"Yeah, that's a good idea.",inactive,39_11,P,ack,
"And in terms of the yoga, let's get back to the yoga for a minute. Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes.",routine,39_12,T,od,
"Well, I just looked at my gym. I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying To go to a gym, and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else. So that's why I didn't really look anywhere else. ",story,39_13,P,id,
"Mm hmm. And so if I were to ask you right now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to 10?",routine,39_14,T,irq,
Maybe about a five or six.,routine,39_15,P,id,
Okay.,inactive,39_16,T,ack,
"Um, well, I, I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it. So I'm interested in doing it, it's just really hard.",story,39_17,P,id,
"So when you see the pictures on your newsfeed, it makes you excited about doing it. But when you actually go to do it, it makes it more challenging. ",routine,39_18,T,crq,
"Well, I haven't done it before. So it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible Other people?",routine,39_19,P,cd,
Mm hmm. And so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people. I'm wondering if that's what Yoga is about flexibility?,routine,39_20,T,irq,
"Well, I think I think that people go to become flexible. But I think that maybe some people are already just flexible.",routine,39_21,P,id,
Mm hmm. So you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest?,routine,39_22,T,irq,
Yeah.,routine,39_23,P,ack,
And you'd be a beginner?,story,39_24,T,irq,
"Well, I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class. ",story,39_25,P,id,
Okay. So what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class?,story,39_26,T,irq,
"Well, I feel embarrassed, I think. And then if the teacher tried to get me to do it, and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose, and I think it would be embarrassing.",story,39_27,P,id,
Okay. So you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain policies. And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class,story,39_28,T,crq,
I think I feel really good.,story,39_29,P,cd,
And so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class?,story,39_30,T,irq,
Right? I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it.,story,39_31,P,id,
What would what would cause you to not being able to do it?,story,39_32,T,irq,
The causes are not we're not sure. Okay.,story,39_33,P,id,
"I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. And I'm wondering, what would make that difference between then and now?",routine,39_34,T,irq,
"Well, when I was a kid, I used to just practice a stretch a lot, and now that I don't, I don't have the same flexibility. Mm hmm. So as I've gotten older, I've lost a lot of flexibility",story,39_35,P,id,
and How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed?,routine,39_36,T,irq,
"I mean, it would be okay. But I don't I don't like that feeling.",routine,39_37,P,id,
What would be the payoff? Do you think? If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?,routine,39_38,T,irq,
"Well, I probably feel really good in the end.",routine,39_39,P,id,
"You know, I can give you I've lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not.",story,39_40,T,gc,
"I didn't really know that. I just thought that that you'll go was For about flexibility, I didn't realize there were so many other benefits.",routine,39_41,P,on,
Okay. So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?,routine,39_42,T,irq,
"Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine.",symp/reasoning,39_43,P,id,
"Good, good. That's a definite improvement. And, and you could determine after that first class, whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not. And that, would that be validation for you? Or would that be? It gives you even more motivation? If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class?",symp/reasoning,39_44,T,irq,
I think that would be a lot of motivation to continue.,routine,39_45,P,id,
" Okay. So one other thing that I wanted to, to mention to you was, you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature. Wow.",routine,39_46,T,gc,
It was only about 30 minutes. It was really cold and windy. So we didn't want to stay out. And by we I mean the dog and I Mm hmm.,story,39_47,P,gc,
"And so because of it, it was cold and windy. You decided to kind of cut the walk short. Yeah. And and that's definitely understandable. I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day.",routine,39_48,T,od,
Wow. It might help if I take a jacket next time.,routine,39_49,P,gc,
"Okay, so if you took a jacket in cases cold, yeah. And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful, that you could be in that would help you even more. Enjoy it",routine,39_50,T,orq,
"as long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better. Okay, and there's lots of trails around my house like that. Okay,",story,39_51,P,od,
excellent. Is It's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise.,routine,39_52,T,od,
Probably.,routine,39_53,P,ack,
And on a scale of one to 10 tell me what that probably means.,routine,39_54,T,irq,
It's probably attend. I can I can commit to that.,routine,39_55,P,on,
"Okay. All right. So it sounds like last week, you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes. But you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home.",symp/reasoning,39_56,T,irq,
"Yeah, ",inactive,39_57,P,ack,
you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home?,routine,39_58,T,irq,
"If I could do them at home, I would probably do them all the time. Mm hmm. I think that would be a big difference.",routine,39_59,P,id,
" And then there would be no embarrassment factor. If you couldn't do the poses less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good. And get out more with people, you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog?",symp/reasoning,39_60,T,irq,
I think it's a 10. I think I can do them on all four all four.,symp/reasoning,39_61,P,id,
Fabulous and how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week? How much of a difference Do you think it would make you feel?,routine,39_62,T,irq,
Perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if I were doing them on a regular basis. Mm hmm.,routine,39_63,P,id,
And how would it make you feel?,inactive,39_64,T,irq,
It would make me feel really good.,inactive,39_65,P,id,
And so you'd feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would do.,inactive,39_66,T,gt,
Thank you so much.,inactive,39_67,P,gt,
summary,"The patient feels anxious. The patient hasn't done yoga classes, cut back on coffee a bit to one cup and taken dog out for a walk. The patient does not like chattering people so find hard to go out with people. One idea discussed was to invite people over home. The patient explains they would feel embarassed if they are not able to do yoga poses. The therapist clarifies yoga reduces anxiety a lot and the patient readily agrees to it. The next idea was to use jacket and take trails around the house that are less noisy for walking the dog. The therapist suggests to do yoga poses at home and that would be no embarassment. The patient confidently agrees they can do all of them on a regular basis. ",,,,
