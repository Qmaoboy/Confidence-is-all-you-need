Oh gosh. Yes.,inactive,186_9,P,gc,-2
"What I want to do today was firstly to give you a blood test result. And then talk to you a little bit about the condition of anemia, and then talk about some potential treatments. ",routine,186_10,T,id,0

And this is your level of hemoglobin. It's 8.7. ",routine,186_14,T,id,0
All that slows.,inactive,186_15,P,gc,0
"It's a bit lower than we would like. So what we're looking to do is to get that back within the normal range, right. Just  to reassure you iron deficiency anemia, which I think you've got is fairly common, up to around 15% of women can experience this type of anemia. ",routine,186_16,T,id,0
Right.,inactive,186_17,P,ack,0
And it's very treatable as well. Yeah.,symp/reasoning,186_18,T,id,0

"It is the condition relates to your blood right. Within your blood there's several components, one of which is plasma. Within the plasma you have your red blood cells. And within that you have a protein called hemoglobin which carries the oxygen around your body to all the different organs. Okay? Now if that's not working efficiently, you start to experience the kind of symptoms that you've been having like breathlessness. dizziness, tiredness.",story,186_24,T,id,0
"Yeah, definitely. Yes. ",inactive,186_25,P,gc,0
One of the causes can be blood loss. So I wondered about your periods. How are they?,routine,186_26,T,gc,0
"Well, they've been heavy these last few months really heavier. I pass it down to my age, you know, this stuff getting irregular and heavy. And, but you might be right.",story,186_27,P,id,0
"Yeah, that may be a fact. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk to you about treatments. Now. There are a couple of things that I would suggest that you try. The first thing we'd like to do is to increase the amount of iron in your diet. Can you tell me a bit about the sort of diet you have at the moment?",routine,186_28,T,gc,0
"So I mean, I'm really busy and I think they have a reasonable, you know, well balanced diet. We eat a lot of ready meals. And then on a weekend we always have a good breakfast it was cooked bacon bowties so so I think it's quite good diet rightYes ",story,186_29,P,id,0
teenage children they keep you busy.,routine,186_30,T,yq,0

It must be hard for you to do all those things.,routine,186_32,T,yq,0
"Yes. Yeah, it's difficult. I just feel yourself can't cope anymore. ",symp/reasoning,186_33,P,op,-3
yeah. Now you mentioned ready meals. I can understand you relying on those for convenience. But the problem is sometimes you don't get the proper balance of nutrients.,routine,186_34,T,gc,0

So what I'd ask you to do is perhaps to adapt your diet slightly and include more iron rich foods in your diet.,routine,186_36,T,cv,0
"Oh, right. Okay.",inactive,186_37,P,cr,0
"Before I tell you about what some of those foods are, can ask if you're a vegetarian.",routine,186_38,T,yq,0
No No,inactive,186_39,P,on,0

"Yes. Yeah, I like broccoli. You know, ",inactive,186_48,T,gc,0
"Ohh good, good I would go with that.",inactive,186_49,P,gc,0

what are those?,inactive,186_51,P,crq,0
