"Yeah, probably for the last eight months, maybe a year even, you know, I have this position at work where I have to make these weekly presentations and, and it's killing me. I can't do it anymore.",symp/reasoning,4_5,P,id,
Tell me about how these presentations are set up.,routine,4_6,T,crq,
"So it's a it's, it's the executive director and it's 10 managers, we're kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update. Five minutes or so maybe 10. At the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted. And but everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around kind of around in a circle. And you know, depending on where you said is what order you present and basically",story,4_7,P,cd,
and you say that this situation the presentation you said it's killing you.,routine,4_8,T,crq,
"Yeah, ",inactive,4_9,P,cd,
would feeling so you have,inactive,4_10,T,crq,
"I feel like it's constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation. And even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I'm so consumed by by this part of my job that I can't I can't do anything else and I normally feel like I do good in my job but but this and, you know, it just, it builds up more like every day the day before is is really bad because I'm prepping for the meeting. And so it really starts to consume me then I don't sleep the night before. And then by the time you know, I get to the meeting I'm, I'm so anxious and so nervous, I'm panicking and everything, and I just can't. I just can't.",story,4_11,P,cd,
"So, so this is this is distressing for you.",routine,4_12,T,orq,
"And this is probably difficult to, to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what's going on then?",routine,4_13,T,orq,
"By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I'm, I'm, I feel like I'm breathing harder. I'm starting to sweat. And I feel like my face is turning red. My palms are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pants. I My heart is racing. And I feel like you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse. I feel like I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder. I feel like everybody can hear it. My stomach just gets in knots, I feel nauseous. And I can't, you know, there have been times that I've managed to like just hold my hand still, and just sit really still. And I've tried some deep breathing and just satin and have made it through. And I have have made it to my, my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words, and I don't say everything I need to even I have a cheat sheet essentially. And I can reframe it. I still feel like I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out and my voice doesn't project so I end up speaking very softly and like I said, I'm stuttering, I just can't get it. Even then, it's it's still I feel like it's still a mess.",story,4_14,P,od,
"You're not you're not happy with the quality of your prison. Now even even when you're able to kind of stay there and conducted, so I want to divide this into the stages. So we talked about the very beginning. So you're already having anxieties sounds like it's fairly intense at that point. Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations. Tell me about what you're feeling as, as the presentations come around to you.",story,4_15,T,irq,
"Well, if I if I manage somehow to get there early enough, and I can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss, or like, like one or two away, then I'm actually pretty okay. Because I can, I can kind of get it over and done. But so many times I'm so nervous and honestly, a bit hungover because I've been drinking too to try and I don't feel anxious want to drink. So there have been a lot of times that I've I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking. And so by the time I get there, like one of the last, it's one of the last seats, so I'm one of the last to go. And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more anxious and panicky. And here in, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave, I can say, I've got to go.",story,4_16,P,id,
"So before before the presentations come around to you, you get up and yeah, leave the room. So in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation, so the anxiety, the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room and when it comes to you actually giving your presentation. You're not happy with that but what strings it level like during your presentation.",story,4_17,T,crq,
"I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything. So everything stops. And then and then when it's done, and it goes to whoever's next. It's like, it's almost like a physical sense of relief. Like, okay, that's over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable. I am so, so upset with how I performed that, that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like, What is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again, and I feel so so miserable, that that I've I feel like I've disappointed him and I've so I've disappointed me. And I mean, this has always, always happened to me. For as long as I can remember, I've never been able to speak in front of groups and you know, from back in college. If I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there's a way out of it. And if they refuse, then I wouldn't present. And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation, and I dropped the class and I took it again, with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it. And High School is the same that I would, you know, I just wouldn't do it. And actually, this is ridiculous. You know, I mentioned drinking. I've been drinking for a really long time. When I was like, I don't know like, 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some, like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and I couldn't do that i bolted out of the room and so never been able to do this ever.",story,4_18,P,cd,
"See if you've had these symptoms for a long time, they've been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people.",story,4_19,T,orq,
"Um, well if I haven't had to be in front of other people I've been I've been kind of okay you know, I can go to the movies but I like to sit on yet and you know, I can go out with with my family and my friends and we can go shopping but I don't like to go to new places. I like to go kind of like the same places that have familiar Yeah, yeah. Cuz because I know them. You know, I know The layout of stores and things like that.",story,4_20,P,od,
"So it interferes with your functioning. Maybe a little bit. But if you're not having to present, it's not as big a deal as it is now for you. Yes job. ",story,4_21,T,crq,
"Yes, ",inactive,4_22,P,cd,
"it's really affecting it. So are you taking any measures? Or have you take any measures other than drinking, you mentioned, to avoid a situation to avoid?",routine,4_23,T,crq,
"Oh, definitely. I mean, there's like I said, I mean, I've run out of the meetings. There's been times that I've called in sick when I haven't been there's been times when I've, I've said I've had car trouble arrived so late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation. I've actually talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my notes to him or to brief him before after and because I have to say that I have this problem. I mean, Normal people don't do this, right? I mean, normal people can make these presents, like the rest of the staff can do it, why can't I? And so I don't want to tell him that, you know, I that there's something wrong with me. I mean, it's, it's gotten to the point that I've talked to him about, you know, this other position that's in another department and transferring so that I wouldn't have to do this anymore. And and it would it would be a pay cut. I mean, it's a demotion but I can't live like this.",story,4_24,P,cd,
" This is too painful. If you had the other job, his other job would involve presentations. So you'd be happier. You'd have fewer symptoms in that job. What's been the result of that discussion? Has there been anything has happened as far as well.",routine,4_25,T,orq,
He has told me that he thinks something In a good job,routine,4_26,P,od,
"excuse me, and he doesn't want me to. Here's what I'm going to change positions. But I can't, I can't do this anymore.",routine,4_27,P,od,
"All right, so you've you've tried, you try to cope with anxiety. You've had to leave colon, colon sick or come in late. You've looked for different position or doesn't involve presenting. You've had this problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations before",routine,4_28,T,gc,
Do you or have you seen any symptoms like this and your parents?,routine,4_29,T,yq,
"Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually. We were kind of joke about it. Some times that we all get so nervous. And my sister, I don't know how but she managed to find a job where she doesn't interact with anybody.",story,4_30,P,ack,
"It's her in her office with our computer by herself. And it's just, it's just hurt. I don't know how she pulled it off. I mean, she doesn't. She hardly talks on the phone.",story,4_31,P,gc,
"And she's really happy and my parents they actually they they met in college. When my dad after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like, you know, I could tell you're really nervous, but today great and they just they seem to bond over this nervousness that they both had.",story,4_32,P,gc,
"Right? So there may be maybe a history, a family history of symptoms. like these, this distressing for you, you tried to avoid it and deal with it but you haven't been you don't feel you've been very successful coping with it.",routine,4_33,T,crq,
We'll get you in for treatment we'll catch in the next couple days to see a counselor. If that's what you'd like to do.,routine,4_34,T,orq,
"Yes, please ",inactive,4_35,P,cd,
