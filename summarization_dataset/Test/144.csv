I don't I don't know. Like I get up, I drink some to make me feel better. I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then.

So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.,routine,144_52,T,gc,0

"I would like to not, I would like to be happy. I would like to not drink I would like to have a good life.

Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.",story,144_61,P,id,-3
So you no longer understand the point of life ?,routine,144_62,T,yq,0
"Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this?
