I didn't really talk to any of my friends about it. But then I yeah, I started to just sort of grow into it. And I took the opportunity to Yeah, enjoy this time and it's so it didn't really reach its peak until after my exams I was still. I was still functioning throughout my exams, and I have since found out that I didn't get the results that I wanted to.",story,158_15,P,gc,0

"Well, having not had to deal with my illness throughout University and for it not being a part of that world, I I didn't confront those symptoms in a in a way that's gonna have long term stability. And as well, it began with doing the work that I needed to do. That's just, that's just what I needed to do in order to achieve my goals and to achieve what I want to. And then it just, I just let it take hold. And I it was all part of it wasn't it wasn't Yeah, it wasn't the illness It was me it was just I was in, I was the master of this whole situation and I was everything that was happening was down to my own doing.",story,158_31,P,id,0
"So it sounds is on the one hand, you didn't confront it, you kind of just let it roll.

"Think the harder I was working, the faster my brain then will work and how much the harder I work, the more I would do. So it was it wasn't. It was just a Yeah, the momentum was building more than anything. My thoughts were firing and my goals was stronger in my Yeah, my determination was",routine,158_37,P,id,0

Okay. I wants you to kind of things were a bit further along after your exams. He said you're going out a lot you convinced your friend to do this app. Was there anything else that you did that maybe you wouldn't normally do that you think might have been assigned to you that your meat was much higher than you'd like it to be?,routine,158_40,T,gc,0
"There was I hide a lot of savings. That my my parents had built up for me, which I probabiliy don't really exist anymore either through the money invested, and through drugs, clothes. I had a girlfriend at the time but because it was because I was the main character, and in a sense, it always was only the only person that matters and so sort of those around me especially, still didn't really have as much importance. So on nights out, I wouldn't. She just wouldn't be in my mind and so that would be Other women. ",routine,158_41,P,id,0

summary,"The patient had final exams approaching and they had to put more efforts. This increased their stress levels and they started taking Ritalin. The patient felt increased confidence, worked a lot harder and were a lot productive but they did not secure the grades they wished to. The patient was in control of themselves for three years. The patient got too involved with substance abuse like cocaine after finishing exams and before results. The patient has been using their parent's savings and got a credit card too to spend on drugs. The patient feels at the brink of succeeding from their hard work and they seem to have fallen trap to the stimulants. The patient had just been getting two to three hours of sleep. The patient has also not given importance to their girlfriend. The patient feels they were not themselves, and people closest to them have been most affected. ",,,,
