And local pharmacies, drug stores have condoms. And there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free. And there's some some ways to that people have found carrying them around pretty conveniently, you know, in their car or in their pockets because they're pretty small. What does it sound like?
