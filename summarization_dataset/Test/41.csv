"In one day, and none of them worked and it was so it was so frustrating because I took so much time out of my work to go and I still couldn't find an appropriate placement for her",symp/reasoning,41_0,P,gc,
my advice would be for you or your daughter to at least and a week at the program.,symp/reasoning,41_1,T,gc,
Again she needs to get the feel no we can't do that I there there's no way I can take her I can't I couldn't drag her back there. Either any of those programs.,routine,41_2,P,gc,
So what are you looking for?,routine,41_3,T,irq,
I need your help to find a program that fits her,symp/reasoning,41_4,P,id,
"if I give you three more programs, Will that work? ",routine,41_5,T,irq,
But But what if they don't work? How about if I,routine,41_6,P,id,
need to give it a chance you need to go and visit again.,routine,41_7,T,crq,
I know,inactive,41_8,P,cd,
"at least whenever out of your busy schedule,",routine,41_9,T,gc,
"I actually came across a program, which is perfect for her. And I really would like for you to help me see if this could work. And I'd rather for you to try to do that instead of me shopping around for other programs because so far the ones that have been offered me have not worked.",story,41_10,P,od,
"So the program that you're interested, you want me to go with you or you want me to, I want you to want me to do",routine,41_11,T,crq,
"I want you to see if, if, if I could choose that program instead of one or the others that you have offered.",routine,41_12,P,cd,
"Okay, well looking at my schedule, it probably won't be until maybe two weeks my schedule is pretty much tied up.",routine,41_13,T,id,
The case just got transferred to me so I'm not very familiar with your situation.,routine,41_14,T,gc,
"Right? I will. My daughter is 17 years old, okay. She she's actually very high functioning thankfully. And, you know, I went to three of these programs. And none of them worked.",story,41_15,P,id,
"So you're looking, you're looking for a day program, right? And something that really was good for your daughter.",routine,41_16,T,yq,
"Right. Right. And, I mean, I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, you know, that would that she really enjoy going to, but, I mean, they were either like babysitting programs or they were just participants were all at like, different developmental levels so that she couldn't really she could make friends.",story,41_17,P,ack,
"Yeah, they were they were not not good for her.",story,41_18,P,id,
"You while you were there, it was difficult. Your daughter didn't really kind of fit in or connect with anybody while you were visiting.",story,41_19,T,crq,
"no, she did not she. She just there just wasn't that that sense of like, that common commonality, you know, just there was no, no basis for like friendships there were there were there were some young people there who are like screaming, yelling and who are talking to them. And she didn't know how to engage. ",story,41_20,P,cd,
And so so just there wasn't when when you visited they didn't sort of the program didn't help you to connect cert help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were just sort of viewing it.,routine,41_21,T,gc,
"Right it Well, I mean, I observed from a whole day each of these programs Okay, which was a lot of time Yeah, yeah. I mean, like I you know, I work full time and I don't, it was very difficult to schedule time to go to these places. And once I did, it was just so disappointing.",,41_22,P,gc,
summary,"The patient is frustrated that they are not able to find a suitable program for their daughter. The patient requests the therapist to try out a program, but the therapist's schedule is filled for two weeks. The patient's daughter had tried three programs and none of them worked since she couldn't really connect with the rest of the participants. There is no commonality for the basis of building friendship. The patient had observed a whole day of program and was very disappointed. ",,,,
