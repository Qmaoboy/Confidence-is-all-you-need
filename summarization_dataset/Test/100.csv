"Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things like doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, so what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that?",story,100_0,T,id,
It just got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel like my stats were much higher than the end. So I guess that was what we talked about the,routine,100_1,P,id,
"habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something like that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're just not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else?",symp/reasoning,100_2,T,yq,
"I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed.",symp/reasoning,100_3,P,id,
Right. Did that change by so yesterday?,routine,100_4,T,yq,
Yeah.,routine,100_5,P,op,
"So you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. So you're doing so well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today like we planned, right. Okay. So this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure?",routine,100_6,T,irq,
That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case,routine,100_7,P,id,
"right. So the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. So did you write the story? ",routine,100_8,T,irq,
I would say like a 70.,routine,100_9,P,id,
Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. So you have that for homework. Okay.,routine,100_10,T,id,
"So I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to so I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. So I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear so I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I just feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. So I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash.",story,100_11,P,id,
Okay let me now your stress level,symp/reasoning,100_12,T,irq,
like 90 ,symp/reasoning,100_13,P,id,
"Okay, you're doing great, just keep going.",routine,100_14,T,id,
"So I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I just keep going. So I walk the dog, come back home, and I just leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. So I can't stop thinking about washing. So I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep. The next morning I wake up, and I already feel sick. I know I'm sick. I'm shivering and I'm, I feel like I have a fever and I'm shaking again and I'm really nauseated. So I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick. And I feel really, really sick.",story,100_15,P,id,
"Okay, great job. What's your level now?",symp/reasoning,100_16,T,irq,
Like 80. Okay.,symp/reasoning,100_17,P,id,
"All right. So just keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you just stay with that image as much as you can. So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. So you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll just make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. So you go toward the leash, and it just makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking oh my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is so powerful, so strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now?",story,100_18,T,id,
