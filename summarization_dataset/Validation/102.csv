"Now, one thing I thought we might do today is to get an example of one of these situations in which you get really anxious. And try to see if we can understand more about how you think and how you feel when you're in the middle of one of those situations. So can you think of an example of something that's happened recently? ",routine,102_0,T,irq,
"My daughter has been, she's actually been sick. And so she had a fever yesterday and they started her on an antibiotic and I had to go pick it up from the drugstore, and that's like, I don't usually go there. It's hard to get there. Like it's not right in the neighborhood. So any expressways or bridges to get there, not expressways, but It's busy, it's busier and attracting a mall. So you know, there are six lanes four lanes. Yeah. So it just, it's not someplace I usually would go. And if I was going to go, usually I would either have her go with me or my husband go with me, but she was sick and he was at work. And",story,102_1,P,id,
"so to try to understand what goes through your mind that's trying to take you back. And now you know that the prescriptions there and your daughter's sick and I guess you don't want to ask her to drive over there. I sorted Yeah, probably not the wisest idea. So you're thinking about doing the drive and what's going through your mind? What are the thoughts that are turning inside?",routine,102_2,T,orq,
"I'm just, you know, I'm sort of thinking about going there. And I'm already starting to think well, you know, what, what if you know what if, what if I'm driving and somebody crashes into me What if I'm driving and I can't do it? You know, what if I just have to stop because I can't do it anymore and, you know, it was raining and I'm sort of like, I've got this picture of myself like out in the middle of the road and you know, what's the picture look like? You're out in the middle of the road and stranded and it's dark and my you know, you know, my shoes are gone. I'm just like, it's like I it would be a million miles to get back home. pretty miserable.",story,102_3,P,od,
Yeah. Yeah. Pretty scary.,inactive,102_4,T,ack,
"Oh, terrifying. Yeah. And I just it's so hard to get there.",routine,102_5,P,id,-2
And Kate as you as you put yourself back into that situation and have those thoughts going through your mind. What kinds of feelings go along with it? ,routine,102_6,T,orq,
"My feelings I mean it things are inside like ago anxiety, physical things are going on. Well fear and anxiety and I just feel really shaky and I feel really like lightheaded and dizzy and I just don't feel like I can breathe very well and",symp/reasoning,102_7,P,od,
It's just a panic attack now? He told me about having some bad ones.,routine,102_8,T,id,
but it's getting there not quite to a panic.,routine,102_9,P,id,
"Yeah, no, it's brewing.",routine,102_10,T,gc,
"Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it feels like it might. Yeah,",inactive,102_11,P,gc,
"yeah. What do you think we might do to try to, to move things along toward getting a plan of attack on this, okay, is to actually sketch this out. Okay, and, and then see if we can figure out some things we might be able to start doing to give you a better handle on that you have right now. Okay. So let's put some boxes here. And one of them is going to be event these are the things that trigger your anxiety. In this case, the event was",routine,102_12,T,irq,
"the driver having to drive to the, to the pharmacy,",routine,102_13,P,id,
"drive to pharmacy. And then this next box, I'm gonna label something we call automatic thoughts. And but automatic, I mean that they occur relatively automatically, they just sort of pop into your mind, and you don't stop to check them out. Okay, and we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts. You don't have them, everybody I know has them their inner thoughts. In fact, if you think about it for a minute, we probably have a lot more thoughts. We don't speak out loud, that are part of our inner dialogue and thoughts, we actually end up speaking aloud other people. Mm hmm. And I suspect that you have lots of those thoughts and just give me some examples of them. So that's what we call an automatic.",routine,102_14,T,id,
So the like the what ifs?,routine,102_15,P,crq,
"Yeah, so let's put a couple of those down in this box. Okay, in the automatic slot box, and they are what if",story,102_16,T,cd,
someone runs into me.,story,102_17,P,id,
Yeah. What if What else?,story,102_18,T,irq,
What if I get stranded?,story,102_19,P,gc,
get stranded.,story,102_20,T,gc,
I can't do it.,story,102_21,P,com,
I can't do it. And then there was this image about the rainstorm and you don't have any shoes on. Yeah. so forth. What should we put down for that?,routine,102_22,T,irq,
I think what if I would if I can't get back home? I can't get back on.,story,102_23,P,id,
sort of lost. Yeah.,story,102_24,T,ack,
Yeah. What if I end up on this road forever?,story,102_25,P,irq,
"Mm hmm. And then we're going to put another box there's a sort of a chain of events here. The event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety. And so if you're thinking like this, it makes sense that you'd be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions. Mm hmm. So let's put those in here. This is the emotion sparks They are much shaky. You said? Yeah. Quite a fear. Yeah. If we're going to write that fear on a zero to 100, scale and zeros, none at all and 100 is the maximum anyone could ever get. Where would you be at this point?",routine,102_26,T,ack,
"Oh, I'd say about an AD",routine,102_27,P,id,
"AD pretty high. Yeah. It's gotten higher though, I suspect. Oh, yeah. This point is in 18. Okay. And then you had some other feelings inside?",routine,102_28,T,id,
"Well, I yeah. I sort of felt like I might fall over. I, my heart was pounding and I didn't feel like I can",routine,102_29,P,id,-2
"breathe. Stomach any lobster. So yeah. So a lot going on here. Yeah. And a pretty high level of distress. Yes, right. And then we're going to complete this loop. Putting a box we're gonna call behavior. This is how you actually acted when you're in the situation. So what did you do? If you had these thoughts and you had these feelings,",routine,102_30,T,id,
I went to the pharmacy. He did do it. I had to okay.,story,102_31,P,gc,
And what was it like for you when you were going to the pharmacy and driving there?,story,102_32,T,irq,
"It was so bad. I just, you know, I, I think I left permanent marks on the steering wheel, because I was whole time.",story,102_33,P,id,-1
"Okay, yeah. So in this case, she actually did go to the pharmacy. That year, maybe it isn't damage to the steering wheels. Yeah. Yeah, I hope not.",routine,102_34,T,id,
"But I really had no choice. I mean, I think usually I wouldn't go to the pharmacy. Usually. I would call my husband and say can you pick it up on your way home, get",story,102_35,P,id,
"an escape route, if you would?  So usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as a model. For many of these situations about driving and feeling, yes, the usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it. Okay? And so if you do avoid it, then what happens?",routine,102_36,T,irq,
"Well, I feel better. You feel better. It's like such a relief.",routine,102_37,P,id,1
"Better relief, the emotions calm down now, right?",routine,102_38,T,crq,
"Well, yeah, cuz I don't have to, like,",routine,102_39,P,cd,
"You don't have to worry about it. So that's what happens for a single episode of this anxiety. I'm wondering though, if we look at the the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief, overall, as far as managing driving, what do you think it does there?",routine,102_40,T,id,
"Well, I feel like I don't really have much confidence when it comes to this to be able to do",routine,102_41,P,od,-1
"it. Okay. So in a way, it decreases your confidence over time. I think so. Yeah. I think suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things. And what's that belief? Yeah,",routine,102_42,T,irq,
I don't feel like I can do I can't I can't do it.,routine,102_43,P,id,-1
"I can't do it. So it really comes back to this thought I can't do it. Yeah. And he can't do it. You don't do it. Right. So here's this, this chain of events, events, trigger thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts, and then they influence your emotions. He's feelings you have and then that influences how you handle the situation. Mm hmm. Okay. Now let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this. So let's take a look at these thoughts. Do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you? Yeah, okay. I mean, an example.",routine,102_44,T,id,
"I mean, I think almost everybody, I think most people drive without too much. problem but like, my sister loves to drive. Yeah, I mean, she just she drives every opportunity she gets.",routine,102_45,P,id,
"So for some reason, we don't know exactly why. But the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you with actually making change in this. But you do have some differences in the way you think about driving. That might be something that we could begin to work on in our session, we might, for example, check it out, what's the chances of someone slamming into you? Okay, what's the chances of you being stranded out there on highway and even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home? So these are some things that we can begin to do. So I'm going to mark here, we could work on these thoughts, okay. And then by working on the thoughts, we might be able to help you reduce the emotions, but there are also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that Would be nice to be able to calm yourself down in situations. So we'll have some, try to build some skills to manage your emotions. And then on this behavior side, one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up. And again, build your skills to do it. And I can see that that causes a little bit of edginess here, what would you think? ",routine,102_46,T,orq,
"I was thinking that I hope that this doesn't like make me worse. Okay, no, like, trying to do some of these things.",routine,102_47,P,od,
"Well, I'm glad you gave me that feedback. That's an example by the way of me wanting to hear from you about the way you're responding to what I'm saying. I certainly wouldn't want to make it worse. Okay, but it cause you too much anxiety. Uh huh. And what we'll try to do is pace it adjust to the level that's right for you. Okay, so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be, which is to be able to drive to your new office, cross a bridge, and maybe even, you know, drive those couple hours to visit your son. Right. Yeah. So what do you think?",routine,102_48,T,id,
"Well, I think that that would if I could do those things that would be really nice. Yeah,",routine,102_49,P,id,
that could be really nice too. So that would be our goal. Yeah.,inactive,102_50,T,id,
summary,"The patient feels anxious for instance when they had to go to drug store to buy medicines for their daughter. The patient experiences anxiety, fear and almost feels like having panic attack. The patient enacts the previous scenario and fears what if they get stranded, lost the way back home or end up at that road forever. These cause high levels of distress for the patient. The patient agrees if they stop driving, their confidence levels will drop so that is not the solution. The therapist mentions these are automatic thoughts, and suggests to work on developing few skills to overcome the fearful thoughts. The therapist envisions the patient will be able to drive to their new office, cross a bridge or drive a couple hours to meet their son. The patient feels very nice about it. ",,,,
