"Yeah, I guess that's what we said last week, but I'm not really feeling it. I really feel it this time. You know, I, I, I know that I said I would do this, but I really haven't been able to stop thinking about it the whole week, and I am sure you know, my chest is tight. I almost didn't come I almost called and canceled. I just I don't really think that I can I can do this. I can't, I can't get in the car and drive over to that mall. If I walk inside, I know I am going to lose it. I imagine these I imagine these crowds of people, you know, going up and down and like, I almost feel like the walls are coming in on me when I start thinking about that. It's Just slow it down so to catch it we can still do this but it's we had agreed to sort of look for Mr. Anxiety and it looks like he's here. Oh, yeah, I found a big time. ",symp/reasoning,201_1,P,id,

"Yeah, this is me all the time. That's why I came here in the first place, right. So we've been kind of working on trying to stand in a different way to it but now we're actually going to do something and here it is big time.",story,201_3,P,op,
Very familiar would you say?,inactive,201_4,T,yq,
"Yeah, that's very familiar. It's very disconcerting as well.",inactive,201_5,P,op,
"Sure. Yeah.  How old would you say those thoughts are like that what you just said do you did you notice there was like an urgency to it they kind of went one after another after another after another like like one led to another another I'm, this is going to happen when I get there, then this is going to happen with me.

And how old is this whole little  I don't mean those exact words. But kind of mmaamma ?,inactive,201_8,T,irq,
"I used to happen to him when I was when I was a kid. You know, when, even when I was, you know, before I was a teenager, okay, same same kind of thing. You know, like, my parents would try to take me out to some public place and, you know, mall or street fair or something, and I just, you know, in the car on the way over, I'd be I'd be a wreck.

Okay. So this has a history.,inactive,201_10,T,crq,
Yeah.,inactive,201_11,P,cd,
"Would it be fair to say that what you have been doing is sort of turning over your life to that, whatever that was. And you've come in here. We've been working now for these weeks. Getting ready for this moment to try to create a space in which something different can happen.",routine,201_12,T,irq,
"That was that was what I hope to do. Yeah, I I've missed out on a lot because because I can't, you know, I can't I can't keep it together enough to, you know, do the stuff that other people do. ",symp/reasoning,201_13,P,id,
Okay,inactive,201_14,T,ack,
go to places other people go.,inactive,201_15,P,id,
"Okay, so now we're up on or right up on where the action happens. Like what do you do when you have thoughts like what you just had? Because you're not there yet. We're not yet actually in the situation where those things are happening yet. But we are right here where those things are being conceived with me on this?",routine,201_16,T,yq,
"Yeah, I think I see. ",inactive,201_17,P,op,
"Okay. So what can we see this sort of kind of slow this down and watch it? We're about to do something and here it comes. Could we take Can I just do something I want to I want to do something. In terms of creating a history. I want to create a history right here, instead of cap something like what this would. What does how the mind works? Hmm, could we do something kind of odd? You're gonna play so let me do something.",routine,201_18,T,yq,
"Yeah, if you want as well. ",inactive,201_19,P,op,
"Okay, okay. I've got a pen here. ",inactive,201_20,T,id,

It says something. Here's what it says it says.,inactive,201_22,T,id,
"The pen says Whoo,",inactive,201_23,P,id,
okay. What does it say?,inactive,201_24,T,crq,
"It says, whoo. ",inactive,201_25,P,cd,
"Okay, we just did it twice. You suppose if I come back in here next week, we sit down I said versus say, What? What do you think and said",routine,201_26,T,cd,
"Yeah, I'll say it as whoo. ",inactive,201_27,P,cd,
And next month?,inactive,201_28,T,yq,
I'll probably still say whoo huh,inactive,201_29,P,id,
"How about next year, is it possible. We just did like 15 seconds. Is it possible next year, that might come to mind if I said this thing",routine,201_30,T,irq,
"Yeah, probably still I'd probably still say whoo.",routine,201_31,P,id,
"But as long as you've struggled with this with the way the mind works, what do you think is going to happen as we come to this day?",routine,201_32,T,irq,
"Oh, I see. So I've, I've been thinking for years that that I'll lose it if I get, get into a crowd and hear what's happening again, and I'm thinking about, you know,",symp/reasoning,201_33,P,id,
"exactly, if that's if that's the determine, determine if that's what we're going to turn it over tomean, we're, we're never like inside Letting that run your life is what brought you in here. Think of all the cost that it's produced. So let's see if we can do something different. I got a ticket ticket a moment to sort of get in touch with how old this is. And the cost associated with me on this  yeah. This pen goes?",routine,201_34,T,id,

if I can learn that a pen goes whoo in two seconds.,routine,201_43,P,cd,
"Okay. So here's what I'd like to ask. We're about to get up and go do this thing. We agree. And it sounds like your mind is engaged. We did it to find Mr. anxiety, right? So it's like we're here And we're right on this pivot point where we're going to do something different. And here's the thing I'd like to ask you. It's different, but With regard to that, would you be willing to do this and as you go, you can tell me what's coming coming up. I want you to actually watch your mind go as it constructs those scary futures and just notice it. Like, sort of like the way you carry something that's fragile. wants you to just to set a notice. Like it's not your enemy, and it's not your boss. It's your mind doing its thing. Would you be willing to sort of do it that spirit? Let's see what's there. This is kind of watch it go.

How is anxiety.,inactive,201_48,T,irq,0

I've been just beside myself ever since last week, thinking that I was gonna have to go through this and I'm not sure I can I mean chest is tight like no sweat running down my back. I'm petrified, you know i suit you're afraid of like what kind of no I actually ",symp/reasoning,201_49,P,id,-1
You go there thinking what's gonna happen?,inactive,201_50,T,irq,0
"Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna lose it I'm gonna lose it before I get inside the front door lose it anyway, I couldn't predict ",symp/reasoning,201_51,P,id,-1
what's going to happen ?,inactive,201_52,T,irq,0
"but I don't know. pass out I go crazy. It's a I hate crowds and I hate being around those people and and, you know, I know I said I would I know that. We plan that we go over there, but it's just too much I just can't do it. ",symp/reasoning,201_53,P,id,-1
"Okay. That's surprising. You'd be thinking this. This is an old thought. It's, it's where you started. I mean, it's how you've been thinking.",symp/reasoning,201_54,T,gc,0
"Yeah, that's true. But that doesn't mean it's not true. ",inactive,201_55,P,gc,-1

Yeah. I guess that's true. I don't have any any evidence that it would absolutely happen alone. sure as hell feels like it's gonna happen.,story,201_61,P,gc,-1
"So well, you know, be one thing. It's worth noticing that and something that for us to kind of hang on to when we go there that when your mind gets on you there that you remember, this is just a thought it's not true as far as you know, from as far as we know, correctly.",routine,201_62,T,gc,0

Okay,inactive,201_65,P,op,0
we're gonna have to do something different. We're not going to get anything different.,routine,201_66,T,gc,0

Donald Duck.,routine,201_69,P,cr,0

it's gonna be go to the car and sir walking towards the the entrance and it's just gonna be bad. It's gonna be terrible.,symp/reasoning,201_71,P,id,0

that's ridiculous.,inactive,201_73,P,cd,-3
"Well, first, you know, the thoughts are similarly ridiculous. I mean here you sort of turning your life over to things that you don't know are true. And that could just be silly thought about what kind of thoughts would come up there could  we actually go there and in mentally, I could Do you sort of have your thoughts being a Donald Duck horse just so that you can see them as something that's silly which may be able to give you a little bit of freedom from them because you know what happens if you just turn you know, turn your life over huh?

"Yeah, I mean I guess they are pretty silly thoughts and I'm not sure that I can do that voice quite so well ",symp/reasoning,201_75,P,id,-1

"I just want you to sort of hang on to that a little bit when it really gets up on you so that you can remember, these things are not true as far as you know. And there's, it is kind of a silly thing to allow them to do what they've done. And so we'll just you tell me what they are. If you can'tdo it mentally in your head, I'll say it out loud. I can probably say most of these thoughts. Donald back wise, would you be willing to do it that way?",routine,201_78,T,gc,0

never mind.What would you say,inactive,201_80,T,irq,0
Okay.,inactive,201_81,P,id,0

"Well, I just get really nervous because I'm supposed to choose I have one more semester left and I get worried because I'm not sure if I'm on the right paths, and I don't want to make the wrong decisions. And then my parents are telling me you know, my dad wants me to do one thing and, and I feel like I just get it thrown in lots of different directions. And, and then my teachers tell me one thing, and I just feel like there's six of me trying to do different things. ",symp/reasoning,201_83,P,id,-1
"If you could settle them down just to to the two major ones, what would be the two major alternatives that you have here? ",routine,201_84,T,irq,0
"Well, I mean, ultimately, my family and I still want to have friends and I'm really young still and I get and then the career choices and wanting to be successful.",routine,201_85,P,id,-1
Okay. Which of those is more important you think?,routine,201_86,T,orq,0
"Well, I mean, I definitely feel a lot better when I'm around people that I love and stuff, but then also, I've always been told careers The most important thing and making money and and all that but I just, I just keep feeling like I'm failing. ",symp/reasoning,201_87,P,od,-1

seems like you're kind of almost anxious when you talk about it here.,symp/reasoning,201_92,T,crq,0

Is there any other way to do it other than just the Nike solution? Just do it?,routine,201_96,T,cv,0
"I don't, I don't see it. I mean, I feel like I am just doing it. I'm just not going anywhere with it. Okay?",symp/reasoning,201_97,P,cr,-1

I feel like I'm covering all the bases.,inactive,201_99,P,gc,0
"Oh, what's inside this choice, I guess?",inactive,201_100,T,irq,0
