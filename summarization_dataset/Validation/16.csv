"Well, I've really just been feeling kind of anxious every time I go to work.",symp/reasoning,16_3,P,id,
"feeling anxious every time you go to work, what type of place to work.",routine,16_4,T,crq,
"I work just an insurance company, sort of an admin assistant.",routine,16_5,P,cd,
Work for insurance company and how long have you been feeling anxious? there?,symp/reasoning,16_6,T,irq,
"Well, I've started a little over a year ago.",symp/reasoning,16_7,P,id,
Have you ever had anxiety like that? A previous employer or any other place?,symp/reasoning,16_8,T,crq,
"Yeah, I would say when I've started new jobs or even in new academic environments, I would feel somewhat anxious. So",symp/reasoning,16_9,P,cd,
"this is somewhat familiar, exciting. Mm hmm. Tell me about things I,",routine,16_10,T,gc,
"um, well, it starts you know, when I wake up in the morning and get ready to go to work, even when I'm driving in, I just start to get anxious. And then once I'm there, I really just, you know, I go to work and I do what I'm supposed to do, but I try to keep to myself. You know, I don't really enjoy interacting with some of my co workers and",story,16_11,P,gc,
what is it that happens when you try to interact with,routine,16_12,T,irq,
"um, I guess I just, I haven't really connected with any of them and I, I tend to worry about whether I'm doing my job right or if they like me, things like that. So it's just easier to stick to my my own office.",routine,16_13,P,id,
"Okay, so you have an office have separate offices. And you find yourself maybe isolating a little bit. Yeah,",routine,16_14,T,crq,
I guess you could say that.,routine,16_15,P,cd,
"So what is the what is your experience of anxiety when you're kind of? I'm sure there are situations and diaries, more or less have to interact with other people to limit your experience of anxiety.",routine,16_16,T,irq,
You mean how I'm feeling or what type of situations that happens in?,routine,16_17,P,crq,
"Well, let's cover both. Let's start with what type of situations triggers it",routine,16_18,T,cd,
"Okay, um, I guess whenever I'm in a big crowd, purchase with a bunch of coworkers. If we have meetings or they ask for my input on input on something, I tend to get nervous and I just wonder, you know, if I'm saying the right thing, and then that sort of makes me get nervous around them. And then when I start to feel nervous, I get some stomach pains. I really would prefer just to stop talking, stop the meeting. And then I get, you know, a little red and blush, as well, whenever we have meetings.",story,16_19,P,id,
Do you ever have a desire to leave? Like if you're in a group just to kind of exterior?,routine,16_20,T,irq,
"Oh, yeah, all the time. Um, I try not to because I don't want to do a bad job and I don't, you know, I don't want to perform poorly. But sometimes the anxiety just takes over a little bit, and I just would prefer to go back to my office and be by myself.",routine,16_21,P,id,
"And how distressing is this for you? I mean, obviously, you're here. So it must be some level of distress but how disruptive is it to your functioning?",routine,16_22,T,irq,
"Why would say I'm, you know, when I drive into work, you know, like it's I feel anxious every day and I've really just been thinking about leaving my job and finding something else where I can potentially even be more secluded and not have to go to meetings frequently or make presentations or anything like that.",symp/reasoning,16_23,P,id,
So meetings and presentations in particular trigger.,symp/reasoning,16_24,T,crq,
"I was saying, Yeah, I would say so. Anything where a lot of people are looking at me more than a few, I guess you could say.",routine,16_25,P,cd,
"Can you tell me a little bit more about the physical symptoms? You mentioned your stomach hurt, when you feel anxious? Is there any other any other symptoms going on? You could feel physically,",routine,16_26,T,irq,
"um, well, sometimes my palms will get sweaty, my face will get red or I'll get overheated. But mostly it's just some stomach pains leading up to you know, throughout the day, like if I'm thinking about what I have to do, that makes me anxious I'll start to get some stomach pains.",routine,16_27,P,id,
"So when these anxiety episodes are more intense, like when you when your stomach hurts, and you have other symptoms, Are you worried about it happening again? Like, are you worried that those symptoms are gonna occur again, that makes you have more symptoms?",routine,16_28,T,crq,
"I'm not always worried about it happening again. I mean, sometimes I can anticipate it happening. And I would like to avoid it. But I would say here and there, I would worry about getting the stomach pains or blushing in front of people, things like that, but it's not every time.",routine,16_29,P,cd,
Tell me about the meetings that you have. You mentioned that you have meetings you have to go to expected. How many people be in a typical meeting?,routine,16_30,T,irq,
"Well, it's a pretty small company, but I would say probably anywhere between five and 10. Most of them are above me though. their positions are above me So,",routine,16_31,P,id,
so five to 10 how often these meetings scheduled,routine,16_32,T,irq,
"About once or twice a week regularly, and then sometimes we might meet more than that if something needs to be addressed.",routine,16_33,P,id,
"Right, so somewhat unplanned.",routine,16_34,T,crq,
Mm hmm. And then some happen weekly. Okay.,routine,16_35,P,cd,
"So for the ones that are planned, you get anxious in advanced welcome.",routine,16_36,T,crq,
"Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, I think about it, as soon as I know, I always know it's coming. So I'm always thinking about, you know, the next meeting that I'll have to present at or how I'll have to contribute. And then I just sort of I think about it until it happens, and then it's a cycle.",story,16_37,P,cd,
"All right. So the meetings triggered, generally not being isolated in the office kind of triggers this anxiety. Right. But there's other times it sounds like we're not anxious when you're isolating the office. How would have hungry anxious now? ",routine,16_38,T,irq,
I'm not really when I'm by myself. I don't really feel anxious.,routine,16_39,P,id,
"So really, it's when you get up for work and start thinking about the work day, especially if they're meetings, right? That sort of starts to,",routine,16_40,T,orq,
"yeah, like if I have off work for a couple of days, I don't feel anxious at all. It's really just when I'm going to work when I know that I'm going to have to be talking to a lot of people or making presentations, things like that.",routine,16_41,P,od,
So you suffer the anxiety advance of these plan meetings? How about the unplanned meetings? What's your experience of those?,routine,16_42,T,irq,
"Well, I mean, unplanned meetings, I, I don't really have a lot of time to think about them happening. But I would say even when I'm put on the spot and have to present anything or just even having a long discussion where a lot of people are looking at me or you know, listening to me for a long period of time, I would still say I get pretty anxious about that as well.",routine,16_43,P,id,
So both really causing say that's really troubling if you're suffering,routine,16_44,T,yq,
Yes.,routine,16_45,P,ack,
"All right. What I'm going to do is because I'm going to schedule you to come and see a counselor here, okay? pi b, maybe later this week. Okay, that'd be okay. That'll work. So I'll take you out to the front. We'll get you scheduled will be treated later on this week. ",story,16_46,T,ci,
"Okay, great. ",inactive,16_47,P,ack,
