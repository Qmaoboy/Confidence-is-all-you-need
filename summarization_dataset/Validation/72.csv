It's good to see you. Yeah.,inactive,72_2,T,gt,
"Again, the year bench record this week is the last last week. It was like, kind of squeaky clean. So how's it been feeling? I'm sure it does. It really does. Yeah. It's been really a process. So that's fantastic. What? Tell me about what's been going on this week?",routine,72_3,T,irq,
I had a good conversation.,routine,72_4,P,ack,
"Yes, I feel good. ",routine,72_5,P,id,
Tell me about it.,routine,72_6,T,irq,
"I just talked with her on the phone. And yeah, it just went really well. And we actually, after that we had a Skype meeting, a Skype meeting last night. Yes, it was. And, yeah, caught up a little bit and kind of talked about some things.",routine,72_7,P,id,
"Great. Yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. happy to hear about that. And then I don't remember I'm trying to think from last time, like any Allen updates or Yeah, nice things going, Okay, good. I'm happy to hear that. And then I guess the other thing that I wanted to, you know, talk with you about I know that we, you know, kind of had mentioned it briefly. But today kind of marks the kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for us like so then over the next, you know, three sessions, we're going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together. And I've been feeling that way too, because it's like, it's hard to, it's hard to want to bring that up, because it's really, it's been really just great working with you. And so I really don't want to see that come to an end. But I thought one of the things that's really important is maybe just to get us starting to talk about and again, we don't have to do it all today but just at least get a starting to talk about, you know, some of the changes that you've made, things that have gone really well for you. And really maybe kind of recap like how it is that you've gone from like almost like binge eating daily to almost now you're not at all and kind of, maybe we can kind of talk about how that's gone. Because I think the other thing that's really important is not only the things that you've done in terms of like, how things have gotten better for you, but I also want us to start thinking about to like, okay, what's going to happen when we, you know, kind of get to the end of our work together and, you know, beyond so like in terms of like, how will kind of how you will kind of keep the work going. And so, I've kind of thought, you know, like, I feel like, I'm kind of being like a wet blanket here. You've had a really great week, and now I'm bringing up our kind of departure. But I think it's really important to kind of mark that mark that transition, and also to market to by having, you know, things go so well. I think it's really important. So I guess the first thing I want to talk about is, I guess I'm pointing my my pad of paper because it's like it's so filled with just all the different things that have occurred for you, you know, over the last several weeks, and I think the first thing that's really notable to me is I really, really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom because I know that that's been so hard for you. And it's been so painful, you know, the way that she's treated you in the past. But that you know, I guess I'm even getting kind of emotional talking about because it just been so rich, the transition you've made in terms of the way you've engaged in a more genuine way and allowed her kind of back into your life and it seems like that that's been, you know, really vital to your you know, like getting better.  So what what's you know, in terms of like, from your perspective, kind of what's that been like for you? ",story,72_8,T,irq,
Yeah. It's kind of emotionally and it feels good.,symp/reasoning,72_9,P,ack,
It's nice not butting heads with her cuz,routine,72_10,P,id,
"I'm sure like, ",routine,72_11,T,gc,
"you want like, I want a good relationship with my mom. I don't I don't choose purposefully to not have a good relationship with her. Yeah, it feels really good. I feel like I can have better relationships, other places as well now because that's healthy.",story,72_12,P,gc,
"Right. Right money. And also to I think along with that, is that kind of the strategies, I think that you've, you know, my hunch would be is that some of the strategies that you've used, engage your mom in a more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respects in terms of like, some of the other relationships that you've had, you know, especially, I know that you and Kathy have gotten closer, and even the fact that you've allowed yourself to kind of, you know, connect with somebody else, like, you know, with Alan, you know, I know you were talking with me the other day about some other friends that you've, you know, met and people that you've really got a little bit closer to so that's been really exciting. Yeah,",routine,72_13,T,gc,
yeah. Yeah. Just get to not go home and feel terrible. Right.,routine,72_14,P,ack,
"Yeah. Yeah. So then, then, kind of from, from your perspective, again, you know, we'll talk more about this in, you know, as you mean, I realize I'm kind of putting you on the spot, but as you've kind of thought about or thinking about it. Maybe you can think about it. To even from now on to the next couple of sessions, but just starting to think about like, what is it that you've really done that you really feel like has been really, that's really helped you make changes in the way in which you've, you know, managed your food or your binge eating.",routine,72_15,T,ack,
"I mean, just really trying to be more positive in my relationships and being more open and communicating, not keeping things in Sofia, like, when I kept things in it kind of bubble up. And that's what made me want to do something that made me feel better. And I yeah, I mean, like, something bothers me, like, immediately express it,",story,72_16,P,gc,
"bro. No, I've noticed that as well. And it seems like that that's been one of the important things that you've done. It's really helped, you know, with the changes that you've made. What else feels like that? I mean, you know, I mean, obviously, that's been really important, but what are the other things that you've noticed in terms of like, you know, how it's been going",routine,72_17,T,gc,
"I feel better about myself. And, like not having comments from my mom anymore and having a guy in my life who really likes how I love. Yeah. And yeah, just yet feeling happier with myself.",routine,72_18,P,id,
"grades are good. No, you know, things like, like we're really in a good space. And I think the other thing too, I was aware of that we, you know, that you'd mentioned to me in particular last time was that and I didn't get a chance to talk with you as much about it. So I think we had so much to talk about last session, but I was really struck by the fact that you It seems like you haven't been as body conscious as you have been in the past. And I didn't know if you've if you've noticed that.",routine,72_19,T,gc,
"Yeah, no, I feel like I've known like a little bit. Notice that Yeah. Especially that you bring it up. It's true,",routine,72_20,P,ack,
"right? Yeah. Cuz I know like initially and even like, there have been times even along the way. When you'll make, like, you know, I didn't feel like it looked very good, or I felt like something felt really tight on me or, you know, I just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me, but it seems like that, that as we've kind of moved along that there's really been I've really noticed a real kind of a little bit of a shift in the way in which you've kind of been regarding yourself. And it seems like it's been a little bit different",routine,72_21,T,gc,
"in that hearing, like, any comments, all my mom about any of that stuff, right. I feel like I've gotten to the point where I'm not concerned like that. I'm going to hear a comment. Right.",routine,72_22,P,gc,
"Okay, but so I'm going to go ahead and make you talk about it anyway. But what did you do in order to be able to get those comments, though, to stop? Because obviously, I think you did something really significant with her. Yes.",routine,72_23,T,irq,
"I mean, I thought about what you said about really acknowledging that that put a lot of pain on me and Justin Lee, and I know I was able to let her know that and is hired scared to tell her that I mean, she recognized that. Yeah. And yeah, she kind of explained how she thought that she was helping me or she wanted me to have a lot of friends in high school. And that's what she, I mean, she kind of said, like her mom said the same thing to her.",routine,72_24,P,od,
"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and that's really not uncommon when you have, you know, it's funny that just even like, not, you know, like, big, big research had, but it seems like that that's pretty consistent, that, you know, kind of, like, you know, mothers to daughters who become mothers to daughters, like sometimes it's kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like, you know, kind of criticality about, you know, shape and weight and, and, you know, some, you know, really proud of you that you, you know, kind of had the courage to address it with her directly and just let her know how you feel because, you know, I think, you know, as a parent, I know that you owe it Like, you know, I always want to try to do the right thing, you know, and I always, you know, I don't purposely want to inflict pain on my children, even though my daughters would suggest that I probably do. But in general, I don't. That's not my goal is to be, you know, harsh and critical. In fact, I really was, you know, try to really be helpful. And I think most parents try to do the right thing. But I, and I think maybe your mom just didn't realize the degree to which that really bothered you and how much that hurt. And in many respects, how much that kind of really drove you to, you know, really, you know, take it out on yourself, so to speak. And so for you to have the courage to bring that up, I think was really helpful. Yeah, yeah. So I really think that that made a lot of differences, as well as, you know, kind of reaching out to others and again, in just the open expression of your feelings, so yeah. So yeah, I think the things that we're doing like now, I think I'd really like to see us kind of continue to, you know, obviously, you still are doing a lot of really good work in terms of like the things that you're talking about and, but yet, I'm also aware that you know, as we're over the next couple sessions, we kind of keep doing a few of these things kind of wrapping up. And then our last session we can more or less, kind of formally, you know, say goodbye and talk about kind of like what the next steps are and, you know, some things you might want to be paying attention to or things you might want to, you know, be mindful of, but we'll get there so yeah.
