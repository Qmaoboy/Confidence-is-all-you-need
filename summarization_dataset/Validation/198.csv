"Okay, Marsha, so how can I help you today?",inactive,198_0,T,gt,
"Well, I'm working full time. I'm part time student. I've just gotten engaged, and I live at home. There's just so much stress in my life, everything happening all at once. Just to top it all off I failed an exam, a really big exam. And I just feel like I can't do anything anymore. I can't do anything, right. I've just got so much stress, and I feel like such a disappointment, such a failure and embarrass my family by failing. Yeah, I just don't know what to do anymore.

"Yeah, just got engaged and weddings just a month away now. So yeah, so just got so much happening. Work is really demanding. Yeah, I just found this exam. It's just, yeah. All too much. ",symp/reasoning,198_5,P,id,
So Imagin you've been sweating on this for a while and it's all been swirling around in your head,symp/reasoning,198_6,T,gc,
"just been building up and so much pressure with everything and I'm living at home so my parents You know, a lot of pressure need to do everything right. And, and by failing this, I feel like I've just embarrassed them and disappointed them and I just don't feel like I'm good enough to go on Studying.",symp/reasoning,198_7,P,gc,
Okay. And have they said much to you about filing exam?,inactive,198_8,T,irq,
"They haven't said much. I was really scared to tell them actually because I knew they just be so disappointed and disinterest by the fact that I did fail. Yeah, I've never failed anything before. And so Yes. Really hard.",symp/reasoning,198_9,P,id,
Yeah. So it's new and you don't like it at all?,inactive,198_10,T,irq,
Not at all. I think leaving uni will just be the way out just so I don't have to go through it again.,symp/reasoning,198_11,P,id,
"Okay, well, I'm glad you've come to counseling, because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion when we've got so much on our plate, and we confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way. And you just said earlier that a whole lot of stuffs on your plate at the moment. Okay. So I'm glad you've come here. Here with the clinic We use the ABC model, which is a cognitive behavioral therapy model. So Marsha, some counselors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use. And we don't realize that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones. Here's the least here. Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment.",routine,198_12,T,gc,
"I think number two,",inactive,198_13,P,id,
okay. Read that one out for me,inactive,198_14,T,ci,
that it's necessary to have a high degree of uncertainty in order to be happy and perform well.,routine,198_15,P,cr,
Yeah. You mentioned that,inactive,198_16,T,ack,
Number 4 that it's necessary to be competent and successful in all those things which are attempted.,routine,198_17,P,id,
"Hmm yeah, that's an expectation from your family. ",inactive,198_18,T,ack,
Yeah. Possibly number eight. That loss should be entirely pleasant ending And enjoyable that any frustration discomfortable pain would be unbearable.,routine,198_19,P,id,
Hmm. Yeah. Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment?,inactive,198_20,T,irq,
Umm probabily number 4. Yeah.,inactive,198_21,P,id,
"How would you put that, in your own words?",inactive,198_22,T,irq,
That I need to be successful all the time andeverything that I do.,inactive,198_23,P,id,
Hmm.,inactive,198_24,T,ack,
Yeah.,inactive,198_25,P,ack,
And is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment?,inactive,198_26,T,irq,
"Well, failing that exam I mean, I wasn't successful with that. So yeah, it just throws out I guess even number two, because throw that all the order in my life. I'd need to have everything. I need to know what I'm doing where I'm going. Yes.",story,198_27,P,id,
"Okay, so if number four is an expectation that your family has given that you have of yourself How do you measure up next to number four?",routine,198_28,T,irq,
I don't feel like I'm good enough.,symp/reasoning,198_29,P,id,
"Okay. All right. Well, what I'd like to do is, is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC. And I'll explain as we go along. ",routine,198_30,T,gc,
Okay.,inactive,198_31,P,ack,
Okay. So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment?,inactive,198_32,T,irq,
"I mean, there are a lot of things, but I think, obviously filing the exam was the main one.",,198_33,P,id,
"All right. And, and the consequences, you thinking of leaving uni. And, and that statement you made earlier about? Yeah, that's, that's the one. That's the crucial one, and I'll explain it shortly when I get up to the board. ",routine,198_34,T,gc,
Okay.,inactive,198_35,P,ack,
"Okay, I think I'll put it up there now for you so we can work through that. So Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is ",routine,198_36,T,gc,
leaving Uni?,inactive,198_37,P,crq,
That's right okay. So it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here. And the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence. And you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit. And you put that in your own words. What are your words before?,routine,198_38,T,cd,
That I'm not good enough.,inactive,198_39,P,id,
"It's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking, hmm. Okay, Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board. And what I'd like to do now is focus, stepping out a bit from your situation and looking, looking at it from another point of view. To me, it sounds like you've, you're doing a whole lot of things really well. Can you list all of the things that you're doing really well?",routine,198_40,T,id,
"I'm working, It's a really demanding job, You know, keeping up with it. I guess. Things that my fiance I mean, we're engaged. So planning the wedding That's going really well. It's stressful, but it's going well.",story,198_41,P,id,
And all of you other university subjects?,story,198_42,T,crq,
"Yeah. never sold anything before. This is the first time I guess all the other subjects? Yeah, yeah.",story,198_43,P,cd,
And you're succeeding in all of those things together?,story,198_44,T,yq,
Yeah.,inactive,198_45,P,ack,
You're juggling it. And it's a lot on your plate at the moment. But it sounds like you've been able to cope up until this point of the one exam.,story,198_46,T,crq,
Yeah. This one just threw me off balance. just failing.,symp/reasoning,198_47,P,cd,
"So, would you describe yourself as successful most of the time?",inactive,198_48,T,irq,
"Yeah, Most of the time",inactive,198_49,P,id,
Yeah. And what's the evidence for that?,inactive,198_50,T,irq,
passing all my fans all the time. I'm just passing my subjects not getting that full time job. It's a great job that I'm doing. I'm getting married.,story,198_51,P,id,
"Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So how do all of those successes compared to that belief that you've written that I've written on the board for you?",routine,198_52,T,irq,
"I guess in comparison, I am good enough.",inactive,198_53,P,id,
"Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And all the evidence is there. All of the subjects that you've passed in first year, and now second year. year round, full time job. That's a success. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. Good. Okay. Well, what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board to dispute that belief. Okay. Yeah. Would you do that?",routine,198_54,T,ack,
Alright,inactive,198_55,P,gc,
Well done last That's a powerful statement. What kind of decision goes along with that?,routine,198_56,T,irq,
Staying at uni.,symp/reasoning,198_57,P,id,
Good. Okay. Knock that on the board first.,inactive,198_58,T,gc,
Okay,inactive,198_59,P,ack,
"Alright, that's good. Good. Okay. So you've made a bit of a decision, haven't you?",routine,198_60,T,yq,
Yeah.,inactive,198_61,P,ack,
Okay. Tell me about it. Does it feel like okay?,inactive,198_62,T,irq,
Yeah. I feel like I should stay.,inactive,198_63,P,id,
Okay. Why is that?,inactive,198_64,T,irq,
"I can try again. Everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time. Good. Good. Yeah, I mean, I could reset the exam. ",routine,198_65,P,id,
"Okay, yeah. Yeah. And we've talked about all your successes. Yeah. So it's hard now to believe that top statement that I'm not good enough.",routine,198_66,T,gc,
"Yeah, I mean, I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize with all the successes that I've had that I am good enough. Yeah. Good.",routine,198_67,P,gc,
"Okay. And so, this idea about staying at uni.",symp/reasoning,198_68,T,crq,
"Yeah I will stay. I am good enough. So I'm sure I can give it another go and see how it go from there. I can reset the exam, and I'm sure I'll be fine.",routine,198_69,P,cd,
"Okay, good. Okay. What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement. I am good enough to say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day, so that you build up your confidence, because it's going to take some time to reprogram you confuse it or up here with that kind of positive belief of about yourself, rather than carrying around that other belief. And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years. And so it's going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system. But you've made a great start here today. So congratulations.",routine,198_70,T,id,
Thank you,,198_71,P,gt,
