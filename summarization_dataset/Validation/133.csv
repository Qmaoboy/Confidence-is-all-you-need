Has it made you rethink your entire job in the profession?,inactive,133_0,T,id,
"Yeah, I mean, it's making me think like, you know, if I just had some desk job, like if I just crunched numbers or something, I would never have to have this responsibility. Like, why would they trust me with a job like this? Like, I'm just a human being who, you know, doesn't know any better than any other person and I just don't know if I can do this. It's just so much responsible. And I guess, I guess before I felt like I could handle it. And now I just feel like it's so much responsibility for one person. And I don't think that I can handle it anymore. But I don't want to change jobs because I've been here for so long. And I liked it before. I don't know.",symp/reasoning,133_1,P,id,-2
you're fearful of this happening again.,symp/reasoning,133_2,T,crq,
"Yes,",inactive,133_3,P,cd,
And how you may handle it? what may happen?,symp/reasoning,133_4,T,irq,
"I feel like it's just around the corner. And this isn't even resolved. I'm still afraid of the consequences of this, you know, like, what if, you know, you know, these kids are out of their parents home. And I just feel like what if something bad happens to them where they are now and then that's going to fall on me and, you know, people, like other my co workers know that I'm the one that did this. So like, if something happens to the kids, like, I'm going to be the one that they're going to blame for it.",symp/reasoning,133_5,P,id,-2
"So just to make sure, I understand your Report. So they were engaging in these behaviors. And your report, just what precipitated the them being broken up.",symp/reasoning,133_6,T,id,
"Yeah. Because, you know, before that, I guess, you know, probably nobody else would have known about it. So I made the report about what was going on. And I think Yeah, as a direct result.",story,133_7,P,ack,
"Alright, let's, let's take a look at the habits, right. So, in CBT, we like to evaluate evidence and try to look at the facts as we understand them. And really, we want to scrutinize and carefully review the facts and the evidence and hold a light to it and try to figure out what's going on. Right. What would have happened with this family if you hadn't work, no one intervened?",routine,133_8,T,id,
"I don't know. I mean, it wasn't going great for the kids. It wasn't really great environment. But I just feel like if I had left it alone, I don't know that the kids would be with their parents.",symp/reasoning,133_9,P,id,-2
"So they all be together. And you feel like, right now. He's saying with them being a part. That sounds good. Is that fair together?",symp/reasoning,133_10,T,irq,
"Yeah, I mean, I guess. I guess I feel like it's probably wasn't great for them to be there. I mean, that's why I made the report. That's my job, but it just feels like, you know, I just feels like I'm playing God. You know what I mean? Like, I'm just coming in here and spend like 5-10 minutes with a family and then totally turn their whole world upside down.",symp/reasoning,133_11,P,id,-2
"you have a tremendous amount of power And if you misuse that power, you could devastate families. That's maybe what you You think happened to you? ",routine,133_12,T,crq,
Yeah.,inactive,133_13,P,op,
" So going back to what would have happened to them, let me just step back there for a moment. They would still be together without your intervention. And that could be a positive. What about consequences that maybe were negative?",routine,133_14,T,id,
"Well, I mean, like I said, I thought they were using drugs in the home. So that's like a really dangerous situation for kids to be in, because you don't know what kind of people are coming in and out of the home, if their parents are going to be, you know, coherent enough to help them if there's an emergency or if the parents are even making them food and taking care of their needs and stuff like that. So I guess in that sense, that's really concerning. And that's a big part of the reason why I made the report.",symp/reasoning,133_15,P,id,
"You made the report because it's your responsibility, but also you had concerns about their welfare. If you could go back and do it again. would you change anything?",story,133_16,T,id,
"I don't know. I guess that's just the hardest part for me is like, I feel like I can't make the right decision. I just feel like I don't know if I'm equipped to be the person to make that kind of decision.",symp/reasoning,133_17,P,id,-2
"So you don't know if you made a good decision or not. And further, you question your ability going forward to make decisions. ",symp/reasoning,133_18,T,crq,
"Yeah, definitely. That's the uncertainty, anxiety.",symp/reasoning,133_19,P,ack,
