"So Sam is healthy other than some seasonal allergies and everything else Okay, then.",routine,83_0,T,irq,
"Actually, not quite. I don't know what's been happening but between last school year and this year, all of a sudden I'm getting these phone calls from his teacher saying that he's not paying attention in class. They think he has ADHD all of a sudden. I mean, I don't know where this is coming from. But this is not the same kid I had a year ago.",symp/reasoning,83_1,P,id,-2
"Okay, so sounds like there's a little bit more going on that and some more worries that you wanted to talk about. So perhaps it makes sense that, that we take a few minutes and then I chat with you, and then I'll spend a few minutes with Sam. Sure. It'll be great. Okay, Sam, do you want to go in, hang out in the waiting room for bed and I'll come find you in a few minutes. Go ahead, honey. So tell me about Sam and the issues that he's having in school.",routine,83_2,T,irq,
"Well, he's like a totally different kid and not in a good way. All of a sudden, this year, I've been getting calls three, four times a week from his teacher, the principal. They're saying things like he's acting out in class. He's having little kind of angry spurts. All of a sudden, he's not doing his homework, which is completely new to me. His grades are slipping. I mean, he used to be like, 70s 80s 90s kids. Now he's getting 60s. So this feels like",symp/reasoning,83_3,P,id,
"a real diversion from last year real change from last year. Oh, totally like night and day. Okay, so it sounds like there's been some problems at home. So I'm going to ask you some screening questions that I asked all the parents, some of them might fit for you. And some of them may not probably take about five minutes, and we'll just go through them together. Sure, let's do it. So why don't we start with how you're doing?",routine,83_4,T,irq,
"Um, honestly, I'm getting by. I mean, I think you know, Darrell and I got divorced last year. He's somewhere out in BC God only knows where.",symp/reasoning,83_5,P,id,-1
"So is he seeing Sam at all, or?",routine,83_6,T,yq,
"I think they Skype maybe once every couple months, but he's really not been in contact. And he's not been sending the money that he promised he would. So we're not thrilled with him right now.",symp/reasoning,83_7,P,id,
So has that meant that finances have been tight or?,symp/reasoning,83_8,T,irq,
"Yeah, I mean, I was kind of counting on the child support to come in. You know, things are tight with three people household and then For almost since long, Darren's been gone. My mother has also moved in with me. She, you know, as you get older, she's starting to get a little bit more dementia. Some people just stick their parents in a home but I was the good daughter and I decided to take her into mind.",symp/reasoning,83_9,P,id,-1
"So lots of changes, lots of things going on. Yeah. And how do you feel like you're managing with all that?",routine,83_10,T,orq,
"I mean, some days are obviously better or worse than others it's been a lot of changes like you said, I mean, I'm not getting enough sleep I'm things are tight financially.",routine,83_11,P,od,-1
"Emotionally, how have you been doing them and managing things are ",routine,83_12,T,irq,
"you know sometimes very stressful, like if my mother has an episode or when I get called from school, but like, I don't think I'm really like depressed or anything, it just it's kind of day to day thing.",routine,83_13,P,id,
"So there are ever any times that you're not managing well, like you're not good at able to get out of bed or do the things that you need to do in a day.",routine,83_14,T,irq,
"There's a couple mornings that I sleep in, but it's really like I still kind of get by I get everything done I need to like, I know it's kind of a tough time right now but I don't feel like it's gonna be hopeless forever. Hopefully.",routine,83_15,P,id,-1
"So some struggles but yeah, okay. Do you ever cope with using drugs or alcohol?",routine,83_16,T,yq,
"No, I mean my mother used to drink but I tried to be really aware of not using that as a crutch.",routine,83_17,P,on,
So then no drinking at all at home?,routine,83_18,T,crq,
no drinking and I definitely don't want drugs in the house for the kids. So none of either.,routine,83_19,P,cd,
What about making sure that Sam and your little one have what they need in terms of winter coats or food or or those sorts of things?,routine,83_20,T,irq,
"I I'm doing the best I can you know, like, we haven't gotten a chance to get winter coat shopping yet. His from last year still kind of it It's not great but it's solution for now.",routine,83_21,P,id,-1
So he's wearing his coat from last year. Yeah. Do you have a sense about is that hard because of finances are there other reasons,routine,83_22,T,crq,
"mostly finances but I mean kind of time too like to get everybody out the door to go grocery shopping or go clothes shopping. It's a big ordeal. Right? I mean, I know. We didn't pick up everything he wanted her back to school this year either. It would be easier to add a few extra dollars in a few extra hours.",routine,83_23,P,cd,
Right. So Sam's not always having the things that he needs right now then.,routine,83_24,T,crq,
I guess not exactly. No.,routine,83_25,P,on,
Yeah. And what about you know food or you deserve food in the fridge? Are you able to put food on the course,routine,83_26,T,irq,
"I mean, we have the bulk foods were membership. So when we do get out I let Sam pick out things he likes to make, you know, macaroni stuff for sandwiches, cereals. That way, you know sometimes he makes himself breakfast in the morn. before school or dinners,",routine,83_27,P,id,
And what kinds of things does Sam have for dinner?,routine,83_28,T,irq,
"Like I said, like he'll do macaroni. You know, sometimes it's not great, but I'll do like the fruit or, you know, sometimes some snack food, sometimes more comprehensive meals, I guess.",routine,83_29,P,id,
I was what would you say he does? Is he cooking? Or are you cooking or both?,routine,83_30,T,irq,
"I guess kind of a mix of both. To be honest, like,",routine,83_31,P,id,
"So with all the stress in the house, has there been any times that people have kind of gotten really upset with Sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful things to him?",routine,83_32,T,irq,
"Not really. I mean,",routine,83_33,P,id,
And what about how his discipline handled in your house? Has anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt Sam in any way?,symp/reasoning,83_34,T,yq,
"No, never. I mean, I used to give him timeouts when he was younger, but",symp/reasoning,83_35,P,on,
"What about sexual abuse? Has anyone touched Sam in a sexual way or an inappropriate way? Excuse me? Yeah, that's a hard question to hear for lots of people. But I asked everybody that question,",routine,83_36,T,irq,
"so no, no, never. I I would never let that happen to my child. Okay.",routine,83_37,P,id,
"So, so he's been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch. Okay. So how do you think Sam's doing in his close family relationships do you think Sam's feeling loved And supported.",routine,83_38,T,orq,
"I mean, I know I guess I haven't really been around for him as much as I'd like to be obviously, I do the best to let them know we know how much I care for him. Sometimes we have a little bit more money, I can get him something nice that he wants. You know, I've heard him kind of, he's kind of a thought that Oh, you love the baby more than you love me. But that's that's obviously not true. I love both my kids.",routine,83_39,P,od,-1
So what do you think he would say if he was here? And I asked him if he felt loved.,routine,83_40,T,orq,
I'd hope he'd say yes.,routine,83_41,P,od,
There's some doubt?,routine,83_42,T,crq,
" I mean, like I said, like I'm",routine,83_43,P,cd,
You mentioned that there was some some some difficulties with your mom.,routine,83_44,T,crq,
"Well, she's lived with us for the past year or so. She was diagnosed with dementia so she has days where she remembers Everything and days where she started to slip more and more. And she just she's very judgmental very opinionated. She has the way she likes things. And",story,83_45,P,cd,-3
has there been any time that your mom has become physically aggressive in the home?,routine,83_46,T,irq,
"No, never.",routine,83_47,P,on,
And what about her relationship with you? How is she managing or how are you managing together with her in the home?,routine,83_48,T,irq,
"Some days are definitely better than others. She like, I guess you could say I kind of tried to check her behavior when she was getting a little bit",routine,83_49,P,id,
And Has it ever come to physical blows between the two of you?,routine,83_50,T,yq,
"No, no just arguments here and there.",routine,83_51,P,on,
And when you mean arguments how intense are those arguments getting?,routine,83_52,T,irq,
"Like we raise our voices I mean, it's I'm doing the best I can here",routine,83_53,P,id,-3
Is it ever it's never come to physical blows?,routine,83_54,T,yq,
"No, never. I'd have to take some other action if that happened.",routine,83_55,P,on,
"And that, that that intensity, is that kind of like arguing or is it like yelling, screaming and door slamming or people throwing objects?",routine,83_56,T,irq,
"I guess you could say we've gotten pretty loud. I mean, she'll go and kind of slam things in her room. You know, I'm, I obviously I wouldn't ever let her hurt the kids.",symp/reasoning,83_57,P,id,-3
And where are Sam and the baby when these things are happening?,routine,83_58,T,irq,
"Sam will usually go and hide in this room, maybe turn this music up. You know, Lee's sometimes napping in the crib in the playpen, I guess to be totally honest, I do lose my patience and scream more than I'd like to but",symp/reasoning,83_59,P,id,
"so it sounds like there's kind of a lot of tension and, and, and arguing in that relationship. How often would you say that that's happening that it comes to that kind of arguing and yelling place?",routine,83_60,T,irq,
I guess like a few times a week.,routine,83_61,P,id,
Can one sort of last question what has anyone in your family been in prison or in jail?,routine,83_62,T,yq,
"No, never. ",routine,83_63,P,on,
"Okay. So thank you very much for sharing all of that. I'm just going to recap. Sounds like there's been a lot of stressors and lots of change over the last year. Yeah. Sam status moved away, which is kind of created some changes in finances, which have led to, maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you've needed or that Sam has needed. You've got, your mom has moved in, and there's some stress and tension and arguing that's happening in that. And you've also told me that maybe all of these stressors and stuff have contributed to Sam not feeling as loved or as cared for. On the other hand, it sounds like you're managing emotionally and that you're not using any drugs or alcohol. You have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical, emotional or sexual abuse. For Sam and his life, and that nobody in your family more in Sam's life has gone to prison. So I think you're right there is likely a connection between kind of what's happening for Sam in school and the difficulties that he's starting to have with all of these stresses and changes at home. So I'm going to book a follow up appointment for you and Sam to come in. And at that time, we'll talk about some of the ways in which I might be able to help or develop a plan together.",story,83_64,T,cd,
Sounds Sounds good. Thank you. Okay.,inactive,83_65,P,gt,
All right. So make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in as soon as you can. Okay.,inactive,83_66,T,id,
And you said you wanted to see Sam for a bit as well.,inactive,83_67,P,id,
"Yeah. You gotta see Sam right now. And then when when I'm done, just make sure on the way that you talk to reception about making another appointment. Okay. All right. Exactly. Last All right. Okay. Thanks. ",routine,83_68,T,gt,
