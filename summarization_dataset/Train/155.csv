"I'm fine. Thanks. Well, strange feeling strange for this, but okay.",symp/reasoning,155_1,P,gt,0
"Yeah, it's something really different for you.",routine,155_2,T,gt,0
Umm hmm I have I've not done this before.,symp/reasoning,155_3,P,gt,0
"Well, why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today?",routine,155_4,T,irq,0
"I'm not even sure I am I heard about this place and that you work with women who are having trouble with a relationship and are confused. And so I thought I'd give you guys a call. And so I'm, thank you so much for taking the time to see me.",story,155_5,P,id,-1
"So you're, you've heard a little bit about the program here. Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what what my role might be today?",routine,155_6,T,yq,0
"Yeah, yeah, cuz I don't know what to do.",inactive,155_7,P,op,0
"What I want to reassure you of is that I'm not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or information at all. I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you to sort out what what's going on and what if anything you'd like to do differently. So this is really up to you. What you would like to explore today, how does that sound?",routine,155_8,T,gc,0
That sounds really hard because I'm not sure I'm very good at sorting things out myself. Yeah. Yeah.,symp/reasoning,155_9,P,cd,0
"So right now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on, and you're not even sure where to start.",routine,155_10,T,crq,0
"Yeah, that's a good way to put it. I'm kind of confused about what to do next. And I have a little baby at home, so I don't I can't think anyway, most the time.",symp/reasoning,155_11,P,cd,0
"Yeah. So now anything any kind of decisions you make, or anything that you do affects both you and and the baby. ",routine,155_12,T,crq,0
"Mm hmm. And, and my boyfriend affects him. Which is why I guess I guess I'm here to talk about him and me and the baby and what we're, you know, how we work together.",symp/reasoning,155_13,P,cd,0
"Well, I if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story?",routine,155_14,T,irq,0
"I don't know where to start. He and I had been together for about a year. And I got pregnant right away and we just had this baby a little while ago. And and before that I was working. And he and I, you know, we're on and off here and there, we get invites and he disappears for a while then he comes back. That's kind of what the ears look like. And I just been getting more and more confused on what to do and recently he did something really that didn't even look like him. He looked like a different person and it freaked me out and freaked the baby out. And quite honestly, it freaked him out too. He didn't he said he didn't know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control.",story,155_15,P,id,-1
"So the in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way and there have been Some incidents where you've had some arguments and then separated for a while and gotten back together but it does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of freaked everybody out. All all of you the baby and you and him and, and was kind of scary. ",routine,155_16,T,crq,0
"Mm hmm. Yeah, he came home. I was a friend come over a man friend, he doesn't like me to have men friends came over to help me with my resume, because I'm starting to think about going back to work. And he had a weird look in his eye and so I kind of, you know, we sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as after right after he left he he kind of just got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was just different than anything that ever happened to me or us together and He just got this weird kind of like he was possessed by something. And he said he didn't, he would never do that again. He's he's really good daddy. And he really helps us out a lot.",story,155_17,P,cd,0
"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand, He's really good. Good with you and good with the Father. I mean, good with your child. And on the other hand, it was just like, what is this something really different?",routine,155_18,T,gc,0
"Yeah. Yeah. And he's, he's, he really helps us out. And I didn't know what to do with that. So that's why it's, I guess that feeling that I have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do.",symp/reasoning,155_19,P,id,0
"What are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do if, if anything, what are what are you thinking about? ",routine,155_20,T,irq,0
I haven't talked anybody for for a year really,symp/reasoning,155_21,P,id,0
gotten pretty isolated ?,routine,155_22,T,crq,0
"Yeah. Yeah, I haven't my parents live pretty far away and, and I guess he's kind of a boyfriend kind ofI guess the words jealous. He just really cares about us. And so I haven't had a chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that will. What could I do, I used to work and I was kind of looking forward to working again. He's he's sort of made it clear that I don't need to work because he's going to take care of us he brings home diapers and gives us some money when he's around and so we really don't need it most the time.",symp/reasoning,155_23,P,cd,0
"So you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and, and yet He, he doesn't really he's expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you. And, and when he's there, he does take care of you. ",routine,155_24,T,crq,0
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it does take care of us. He's, uh, he's he makes sure that I have enough money for, you know, the basic needs in the house and he pays the rent and, and you know, but when I when he's gone and I run out of money, it just kind of that's when I think cut it. Just wish I could take a little bit by myself. I just not sure how to go about doing that.",story,155_25,P,cd,0
"Does that leaves you in a real bind when you're, you're there and you don't have what you need?",routine,155_26,T,irq,0
"And I yeah, and I don't know who to talk to about that. I try to call him sometimes and make up you know, and say sorry for the fight that we had and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.",symp/reasoning,155_27,P,id,-1
"So you've kind of find yourself when you're in that bind, trying to find ways of, of getting getting what you need.",routine,155_28,T,gc,0
"Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know how to do this. I mean, I don't know what to do next. Not very good at it.",symp/reasoning,155_29,P,gc,0
"I just want to say we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you. But I just want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate how hard this is to be able to talk about it. And it's it's not an easy situation, and you're definitely not alone. And I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it.",routine,155_30,T,gc,0
Thanks. It's really hard to,symp/reasoning,155_31,P,gc,0
Yeah I know. There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are that that many women in very similar situations find themselves and things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and Figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be?,routine,155_32,T,gc,0
okay,inactive,155_33,P,gc,0
"And and some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship, you've mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it's can be really good and, and then he can be gone for a while and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that. We can certainly talk about resources about the resources in the community that may be there for you, or in terms of your own understanding. But also if you if you are in need of additional help, we can talk about those. We can talk about safety planning. I mean, one of the one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and in your baby safe. And we can talk about that. We can talk about finances. You mentioned that you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now. We can certainly For that a little bit more, taking care of yourself which,",routine,155_34,T,gc,0
"yeah, right. ",inactive,155_35,P,gc,0
"Yeah, yeah, for many, many new new moms that's hard under any circumstances to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy. So that's certainly something we can talk about. And also just the whole issue about taking care of your child and, and your, your mothering your parenting, how you might, how you might focus on that and in this situation, or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front. Just to start with, what do you think?",routine,155_36,T,gc,0
"Well, it's, it's funny as you're showing me this, I I've been thinking, all I've been doing is focusing on the baby and being a good mom and and, and yet, I'm also trying to think about getting a job and I don't know how those two fit together. And even as I'm just saying that out loud. I'm not even talking about taking care of him. Which is weird that I'm not even when I look at this these circles I am looking at mothering and children and finances and that seems to be important yet I'm spent I spend so much time thinking about him all the time and right now I'm not",symp/reasoning,155_37,P,od,0
"so maybe you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with what what it means and where it is. And now you're kind of think well, maybe I think about some other things and see where I might go with those.",routine,155_38,T,gc,0
These things if the job and taking learning how to be a better mother and might be a might help the relationship so that might be,symp/reasoning,155_39,P,gc,0
so might be a way that focusing on how you might be able to take care of yourself get get a job or look at the possibility of doing that and the same time trying to incorporate you're taking care of your child that those things might help you um Free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship?,routine,155_40,T,gc,0
"What to do about the relationship? Yeah, what to do about the relationship? I'm not sure what to do with a relationship.",symp/reasoning,155_41,P,cd,0
"Yeah. You know, you're the only one that that really will know about that about the dealing with the relationship about what, when the timing is right for any decision that you make one way or the other.",routine,155_42,T,gc,0
"I don't even know what to think about that. I don't know how to. Yeah, I don't feel like I've been making any decisions. ",symp/reasoning,155_43,P,gc,-3
"Yeah. Well, and it sounds like you'd like to think about making some decisions in other areas. And, and when you think about that, is that right? Would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job? If that's something you'd like to talk about? ",routine,155_44,T,gc,0
"Yeah. And how to balance that with being a mom at the same time, because that sounds really hard.",symp/reasoning,155_45,P,op,0
"Well, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work when after the baby was born, what what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that? And and in thinking about thinking about that, what have you thought about?",routine,155_46,T,gc,0
"Well, I guess I think initially that I would need his help more, he would need to help take care of the baby. He doesn't do that. Now. So I don't know. And it be kind of scary that I don't know what that would look like. So I would have to find some other help to get to be able to go to work even just part time, so I could get some childcare or something. Yeah. ",symp/reasoning,155_47,P,od,0
So you might have to explore some other options for the child care and in other ways of taking care of the baby so that you would be feel okay about going back to work?,routine,155_48,T,gc,0
"Yeah. Yeah. Somebody I trusted. Yeah. And I'd have to figure out just the timing of that and a job that would fit a schedule where I could still breastfeed and help her with her naps and make sure I'm there for bedtime and all those important times, but make enough money that it was worthwhile to, to do it. Yeah, to be out and working and paying somebody. That sounds like a lot.",symp/reasoning,155_49,P,gc,-1
"It really does sound, though, like you, you're really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things the basic needs and really taking care of your child at the same time. ",routine,155_50,T,gc,0
Umm Mm hmm. It's very important to me. I didn't I didn't think I was I wanted to have children. And then we did so. I would like him to be a daddy in that. Wow. Just well as I was thinking about him not being around as the daddy and I'm not really sure what to do with that. But the baby the baby is the most important thing right now.,symp/reasoning,155_51,P,gc,0
Right,inactive,155_52,T,gc,0
I didn't realize that I've spent so much time thinking about him all the time. And when we can hear back and does he love us? And why the heck did he do that that weird thing and why does he care about these other things that he cares about?,symp/reasoning,155_53,P,gc,0
"Like being jealous, not wanting you to have friends?",routine,155_54,T,crq,0
"Yeah, why does he. And it has nothing to do with what I'm thinking about now, which is the baby and",symp/reasoning,155_55,P,cd,0
"but it's, we've mentioned that a couple times now that it that it sort of surprises you, the way you're thinking about it in the way you're approaching it. Like you're recognizing we're seeing that you've spent a lot of time really agonizing over over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship or what it really means you've spent a lot of time there. That kind of surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently",routine,155_56,T,gc,0
"agonizing I guess that's what I've been doing. I feel like I've just been hoping and wishing and it seems like all my focus is always so when the baby's crying and I'm worrying about him and and and so the baby crying is just it's hard, but but if just now talking about it letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing that I could actually think about why the baby's crying as opposed to why why is he not returning my calls? or Why did he give me that look, when I you know, talked about getting a job and things like that it's not so interesting. ",symp/reasoning,155_57,P,gc,0
So you're realizing to how much it really takes to focus attention on on the baby. And to be able to Do it and it's like I it's hard to do both. It's hard to really think about doing both.,routine,155_58,T,crq,0
"I need his help with that. Yeah, I don't need to be worrying about him too.",symp/reasoning,155_59,P,cd,-1
Hmm,inactive,155_60,T,gc,0
I don't understand what safety planning means.,symp/reasoning,155_61,P,crq,0
"Well, one of the things that we we look at is trying to help people who are in a situation similar to you where, where there might be some where there might be some fear about something that could that might happen, or you know, and I know you said he had indicated that he wouldn't do it again. But sometimes it really helps people to feel to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe, if that's what needs to happen.",routine,155_62,T,cd,0
"So if he kind of got that weird look in his eye again, which actually I've seen before, but he just never really did anything like this before.",symp/reasoning,155_63,P,gc,-2
He just went farther this time?,routine,155_64,T,crq,0
" Yeah. Okay, so like, if I recognize if I saw that look What to do? ",symp/reasoning,155_65,P,gc,0
"Yeah, yeah. And, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know, there might be places that you can go to get saved, there might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe or make sure that the baby's safe for people to call or think just things that you can do based on what your life is like and what you what resources you have available to you. Is that something you're interested in really exploring?",routine,155_66,T,gc,0
"Sounds kind of freaky to think that I would have to keep myself safe from somebody that says he loves me and you know, love the baby. Sounds a little strange.",symp/reasoning,155_67,P,gc,-1
Some ways it just seems like it shouldn't have to be that way.,routine,155_68,T,gc,0
"No, shouldn't have to be  that way. But I didn't expect him to do what he did either. So That kind of came out of nowhere",symp/reasoning,155_69,P,gc,-1
"really took you by surprise. It's something that you're just trying to figure out where, how does this fit and what it what does it mean? And what do I do with it? What what how do I how do I respond to this? ",routine,155_70,T,gc,0
"Yeah, it doesn't seem real. So I guess, thinking about thinking about that kind of makes sense ahead of time.",symp/reasoning,155_71,P,cd,-1
"Yeah. Well, let me see if I if I got it all and then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that. I want to make sure I understand a little bit about your situation. ",routine,155_72,T,gc,0
Okay,inactive,155_73,P,gc,0
"And this first of all, this is the first time you've come in. This is the first time that you've had something that really happened, this incident that happened where he pushed you really prompted you to to take some steps because it scared you and you you are wanting to protect yourself and your baby. You Really want to protect the baby, you have this relationship that's been cut off and on and but he's been very supportive and helpful in terms of giving you meeting your basic needs and the baby's basic needs and wants to take care of you and, and there are times when it's really good. And there are times when you've been less sure and this is this incident has also made you to kind of think about that some of the ways that you've been thinking about or thinking about it now kind of surprises you but you're looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit so that you can have more financial independence, if you will, or be able to take care of yourself at the for those times when you need to. And you're starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe. Did I kind of get it all",routine,155_74,T,gc,0
"that yeah, that kind of captures it all. Yes. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know where to start. But I guess that's why I'm talking to you. ",symp/reasoning,155_75,P,gc,-1
"Yeah.Yeah. So maybe we can, we can take that next step in and when when when we get together again and we can do that we can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those in both of those areas for keeping yourself safe and, and for, you know, looking at the possibilities because there are options and resources out there should you choose to make the decision to go back to work, there are some options for you.",routine,155_76,T,gc,0
So there's like a good somebody can help me work on my resume or something like that.,symp/reasoning,155_77,P,gc,0
There are other options for for a variety of things and we can make some have some discussions about that.,routine,155_78,T,gc,0

"Well, I really appreciate again, you're coming in today, and we will follow up with this conversation and in it, you you will have it hopefully to give you what you needed to make any decisions that You need and again they are your decisions about what if anything you want to change and what your next step is.
