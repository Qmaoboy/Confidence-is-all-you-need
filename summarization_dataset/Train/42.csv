So, I mean, yeah, but just so you know, I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that. ",story,42_11,P,id,
"Okay, so to me, it seems that drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends. It's your way to socialize and it breaks that is right, it helps you socialize and, you know, I'm I also wanted to say that it's very responsible of you to be drinking and not driving. Thank you. How has it affected your life?",story,42_12,T,irq,
"Who hasn't? Well, I mean, none of this happens and you have it because of that firefight. And he's gonna be disappointed. Sorry. I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry, it's been great, fantastic. But he says that when I drink, it's like, I'm not myself. It's like somebody who's never met before. And obviously, you can imagine the arguments, the fights, and oh my god, all that stress. It's just, I love them so much, but you know, but it's a stress and it's like, I don't forget to make it.",story,42_13,P,id,
"So for my understanding, drinking, it helps you socialize with friends, it relaxes you. It's, you know, your way of just, you know, it breaks that ice for you.

And it's causing a lot that all those arguments are leading to a lot of stress in your relationship, this kind of stuff.",story,42_14,T,gc,
"Yeah, I mean, we're engaged in this as well. Like you put it that way, I mean, worried because what's he going to think of you later on in life? What's he going to tell our children? Oh, your mom's an alcoholic. She drank this and they got into fight. I don't want I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way. But at the same time, I mean, I don't want to quit cold turkey. I mean, you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it. But I love him so much. I mean, I would do anything for him. And he's going to be so disappointed in me hasn't even seen him like, I don't know, how can I face them?",story,42_15,P,id,
This seems like a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much.,routine,42_16,T,id,
"Boy, seriously, he's not gonna find anybody that loves him. As much as I do. Trust me on that is not going to happen.",routine,42_17,P,od,
"So what I'm getting here right now is that if you do want to quit, yeah, yeah. And it's just partly because this alcohol is divided into the arguments with Henry and his positive SSL relationship. Yeah. I know we spoke about earlier and I know you don't really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it? Like what's your one shed some light on that",story,42_18,T,irq,
"it's a place where alcoholics go to discuss their problems and like I said, I'm not an alcoholic.",routine,42_19,P,id,
"Well, you're a different multiple philosophy life and this share the drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. Okay? I know you don't want to join a at this point in time 10 times but hypothetically speaking, generally consider joining it maybe later on down the road.",story,42_20,T,irq,
If this is what I have to do to get my guy back and I'll do it.,routine,42_21,P,id,
"Okay, well on a scale of one to 10 being like for sure. And one being not really sure about it at all. What would you say where you are on the scale with God any? ",routine,42_22,T,irq,
"You put it that way? Everything I told you, I would say Six, ",routine,42_23,P,crq,
six. Yeah.,routine,42_24,T,ack,
"Well, it's all about, it's all about Henry at the end of the day, it's it matters to me if I want to keep this engagement, and I will do anything for that man. So of course, this is what I have to do in this. This is him. Let him tell you, his relationship with me.

"I love you, man. Like I said.",routine,42_26,T,gc,
I'll tell him that.,routine,42_27,P,gc,

"um, you know, like, flexible hours, maybe that isn't even an option. Um, also, maybe there's maybe there's a place nearby somewhere like nearby My house, I'll be great. So I have to use gas because it's expensive already to go to work and it's far anyway. And I'm like, I guess, I guess it has to do with attitude as well. I don't want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look in my drinking habits and all that, so I guess I'm just looking for a good vibe, you know, I don't want to be judged or labeled.",story,42_29,P,id,

And yeah, we all have very busy schedules. Now the fit is very busy schedule. It definitely makes sense. And of course, the environments I mean, if you're not happy, they're just a human a learning environment. If you're not comfortable there, then it's very hard for you to you know, to be in that environment. Yeah. blotchy today, I was wondering if it's okay with you, I can give you this for sure. It's just for a median. You're really close to your location where you live, okay, and my number is also on there. Give me a call if you have any concerns. And also, I just want to thank you today for sharing me your stage of drinking. And I know it's not, you know, easy to just notice. No, it's a very sensitive subject. Yeah. So I want to thank you",story,42_30,T,id,
