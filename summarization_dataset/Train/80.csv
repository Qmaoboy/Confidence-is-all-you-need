"Do you have on your presentation? Do you have so many? Like bullet points you want to cover? Like,",routine,80_0,T,irq,
"yeah, okay, like an outline sort of thing.",routine,80_1,P,id,
Okay. Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points?,routine,80_2,T,orq,
We never thought about that.,routine,80_3,P,od,
"I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation. Maybe you'd have 10 or 20. Yeah, depending on how long right so maybe you as you start to review a certain bullet point As you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply. And then as you continue on, you just let out that breath really slowly,",routine,80_4,T,id,
"like a rhythm sort of, huh? Yeah. Can you go and do the same thing?",routine,80_5,P,irq,
" I thought about it that way. I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure. So you would, you would get in so many breaths,",routine,80_6,T,id,
something I wouldn't forget. Yeah.,routine,80_7,P,id,
"Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit. Okay. Just make sure you keep your bullet points of length. About a few paragraphs. Yeah. But just just a few seconds each. So you can get a good deep breath and, or you could, you know, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously, several breaths, but just some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete. Yeah. Because I know that. In that moment, things are probably like you mentioned zoning out and right It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.",story,80_8,T,id,
"Yeah, exactly. And just get really foggy, almost dizzy.",symp/reasoning,80_9,P,ack,
"Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths. And that might be something you can really have one too. Yeah. And would we kind of cut through that fogginess something could still do. Okay. When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up?",routine,80_10,T,irq,
"The next one, I believe is next Friday.",routine,80_11,P,id,
Is that the next presentation you have? Like in all the classes is the one,routine,80_12,T,yq,
Yeah. .,inactive,80_13,P,op,
Okay. And that's next Friday. Mm hmm. Do you know where you are in the order? Like for presenting?,routine,80_14,T,irq,
"Um, I think I'm actually third in this one.",routine,80_15,P,id,
not first. And this one's how many minutes,routine,80_16,T,irq,
I'm like 15 or so.,routine,80_17,P,id,
"Okay, it's a little shorter than 20 minutes. So you have about a half hour, maybe a little more, if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there, right. And potential time where you could be anxious. Yes, but also potential time and you could be reviewing the notes your bullet points and breathing.",story,80_18,T,id,
Yeah.,inactive,80_19,P,ack,
"And saying to yourself, that's so like, kind of self talk, that they're not really paying attention to me anyway. Right. Right. Because that might help reduce that. That anxiety. Yeah. What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there?",routine,80_20,T,irq,
"I guess I could say that, you know, in general, I do pretty well. You know, one bad grade as in going to war. Make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here.",symp/reasoning,80_21,P,id,-2
"Okay, so the sort of self talk up there could be I deserve to be here.",symp/reasoning,80_22,T,cd,
"Maybe I've prepared enough, you know that I know that I've prepared. And I'm a good student. Okay.",routine,80_23,P,cd,
I've prepared enough. I'm a good student. I deserve to be here.,routine,80_24,T,cd,
Yeah.,inactive,80_25,P,ack,
Is that something that would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can?,routine,80_26,T,irq,
"Yeah, I think it would actually, I can recite that.",routine,80_27,P,op,
"Yeah, internally as you because it's not long.",routine,80_28,T,id,
" I think I could, it will be easy to remember. And I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something.",symp/reasoning,80_29,P,cd,
And how much do you believe that those statements are true?,routine,80_30,T,orq,
"I think you know, sitting now, sitting here now I believe them in the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convinced myself otherwise. But I think I actually believe that that that that's true. They deserve to be in the program.",routine,80_31,P,od,
"Okay, so there's those self talk items. You believe them to be true. Yeah, but you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this. You might not believe them as much, right? But remember that, you know, we worked on them. Right? You came up with them.",routine,80_32,T,id,
Yeah. ,routine,80_33,P,ack,
And you believe them now. Right? So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself. ,routine,80_34,T,id,
Yeah. It's easy. I realize it's easy to form these plans. Right.,routine,80_35,P,ack,
"Then the chaos of anxiety in the words is harder. So the more tasks you can make concrete, and you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be. Okay. I would like to see you your presentations next Friday. Yeah, I would like to see you right before that. So be about a week. Okay for that. Do you have any questions? These are items you can rehearse still even without the presentation, the self talk and write the breathing, and of course preparing. But you have any questions between now and then you think?",story,80_36,T,id,
I don't think so I think it makes sense. Yeah.,inactive,80_37,P,on,
Understand kind of the plan to attack that anxiety symptom,symp/reasoning,80_38,T,id,
"And I think you know, what you kind of suggested before, like, maybe practicing my deep breathing. Like maybe now, like when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like, I'm more apt to also remember it, then.",symp/reasoning,80_39,P,id,1
"Right. So, so good. So you have some kind of behavioral pieces. Focus on studying the breathing. And so cognitive pieces that the self talk we talked about, yeah. That you use when you're seated and use when you're at the podium,",routine,80_40,T,id,
right,inactive,80_41,P,ack,
"And actually presenting. Alright, good. So I'm glad we have a plan going forward. I think that you did a really good job today, helping kind of untangle this and figure out what's going on. And I appreciate that. You were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they're related. Yeah. And I feel like this is something that's going to serve you well as you move through this. ",inactive,80_42,T,id,
Thank you.,inactive,80_43,P,gt,
"All right. So I'll see you in, in a week. ",inactive,80_44,T,id,
Okay. Thanks.,inactive,80_45,P,gt,
"Thanks, Hazel.",inactive,80_46,T,gt,
summary,"The therapist is helping the patient with a presentation by using bullet points to cover. The therapist requests the patient to take deep breaths, in some structure while reviewing the bullet points. The patient is trying to avoid zoning out or dizziness. The therapist suggests three deep breaths per bullet point. The patient has a presentation next Friday and they have half an hour before their turn to present. The patient plans to practice breathing during that time, give themselves a self talk that they are a good student and one bad grade doesn't mean they don't deserve to be there. The patient is asked to make a card to recite these. The therapist also acknowledges that these may not be easy in the actual situation and asks the patient to practice this continously since this can be practiced without the presentation. The therapist asks to rehearse and meet them before the presentation, in a week. The therapist asserts to the patient that they are attacking the anxiety symptom. ",,,,
