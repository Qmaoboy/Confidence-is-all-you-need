"All right, let's How are you? ",inactive,33_0,T,gt,
"Good, good. ",inactive,33_1,P,gt,
It's good to see you. Yeah.,inactive,33_2,T,gt,
"Yeah, I mean, good week with the roommates. I had a good conversation with her about like, what times are good for boyfriend to be over and kind of giving him better heads up on when I'm really mean.",routine,33_3,P,gc,
"Silence. Terrific. So what was what specifically? I mean, I know we've talked a lot about that, but what specifically did you say to her, or how did you bring it up",routine,33_4,T,irq,
"is just telling her that like, my studies are really important and I understand like, it's also important that she time with her boyfriend, but that I would really appreciate that this is both our space and that there are times when like, we really need to respect each other's space. And yeah, she responded really well. Yeah, she was like, just really give me a good heads up before. Terrific. You. Yeah. And that we kind of decided like certain times are more appropriate for them to have the living room and not",story,33_5,P,id,
"right. Right. Right. Because I think that's really similar No, we kind of talked about that. Because I remember like a few sessions ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems like one of the ways that you've we talked about that before in terms of like, you know, first starting that oftentimes one of the ways that you manage your feelings that you kind of you think you're letting people know what you're you know, feeling but it doesn't really come out. And I know that it's something that you and I had to really like you know, kind of work out but sounds like that. You were able to talk with her in that She heard you. And as I want, as I kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in a very positive way.",story,33_6,T,irq,
So I think being a little way direct was helpful.,routine,33_7,P,id,
"It's really nice, I think to you've been able to do that more with me, and I feel like that, that I feel like it's been really helpful. I know, they've been kind of pushing you on that. And that's been hard, but I feel like it's been really nice to feel like it's really been helpful with your relationship with Kathy. So that's fantastic. And also, you know, again, I know that I've keep, you know, like saying this over and over again. But you know, as you've worked on these things, it's been really notable that it's really had a nice positive effect on your eating because it seems like it's really you've really seen a lot of real nice improvements. So awesome. Anything else that you know, so you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything else go on this week? Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke.",story,33_8,T,irq,
"At home for two days, and it was with my mom and Okay,",routine,33_9,P,id,
okay. So she's still sixers. Did she have a birthday recently?,routine,33_10,T,irq,
He's awesome.,routine,33_11,P,id,
"Oh, that's great. almost seven great. You plans for birthday for her or what are you",routine,33_12,T,irq,
She really into frozen?,routine,33_13,P,id,
"Okay? Like anything frozen. Okay, okay, okay. Yes. Okay, that sounds terrific. And so then you spend some time with her. So obviously that was real positive for you. Did you? When you were there? Did you have any opportunity to, you know, visit with your mom? or How did that go? I",routine,33_14,T,irq,
"I think my mom was around like we kind of all spent time together. And like she asked about school. They were like, tell her a little more about school and how things are going. Yeah, we don't really get a one on one time.",routine,33_15,P,id,
"How does it feel for you in terms of like for her? I know you've talked about not really liking that. She all the sudden, is deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life. But how is it for her to kind of like want to want to know how things have been going for you. I mean,",story,33_16,T,irq,
"I've kind of like allowed myself to tell her I guess I don't think have been going. I mean, like, to an extent, like it was like it broke and whatnot like we don't really sit down just do together.",story,33_17,P,id,
"So kind of what we had discussed kind of that you've been, you've like, you've been allowing yourself to be more connected with her, but you're still kind of keeping up keeping a little bit of a boundary. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that's gone on, you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it's just, you know, kind of like the wondering about that. I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on, but then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke, you know, even I still even remember to, for her to have gotten to the point where she wouldn't even let you like go to your grandmother's funeral or at least you know, kind of, so all those things have been so like, you know, front and center, you know, and so now I feel like that she's made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being a mom, that sounds like that. You're really working to try to manage that in, you know, in a better way?",story,33_18,T,irq,
"Yeah. I mean, like we still butt heads a little bit. I'm sure Shane but",story,33_19,P,id,
"yeah, yeah, but when you do butt heads, what is it how what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of like you feel like that there's a little bit of a friction.",story,33_20,T,irq,
"I mean, I guess that's like, kind of leaps back to things like things are really good this weekend for the most part and then kind of when I was leaving she just like, either just brought up things about wanting to know more about life and whatnot and what's going on at school and if I'm seeing anyone, yeah, it's just like, we don't have that relationship.",story,33_21,P,id,
"Right. So that really, that's a really stressful time?",routine,33_22,T,irq,
 like when I got back to school like right after that. And like caught me.,routine,33_23,P,id,
"Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, you know, we've really reviewed this quite a bit but You know, historically, that's how it's been, you know that that's really been a real enemy. It really clarifies why we're working on this because it's so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patches, that it really all of a sudden evokes all these like negative feelings. And that's when food like really, you know,",story,33_24,T,irq,
"you know, all comments, though. Yeah. What I'm wearing. Right. Right.",inactive,33_25,P,id,
"Right. Right. Yeah. So it's really hard to, you know, I can understand it's really hard to let that go. I mean, cuz obviously, there's a lot of lot of feelings that you have about that. Yeah. Yeah. But on the other hand, too, it seems like that, you know, things have been going really well. How have things been going in terms of just in general like school friendships, you know, anything else that's on the horizon? ",routine,33_26,T,irq,
"yeah, kind of scene guy.",routine,33_27,P,id,
I won't get too excited about that. But tell me about him telling you about him.,routine,33_28,T,crq,
"Yeah, he felt like my mother.",routine,33_29,P,cd,
Now what's this? You have to at least give me his name? What's his name?,routine,33_30,T,irq,
His name's Alan.,routine,33_31,P,id,
"Alan. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, did you like, I'm not gonna blow this out of proportion. But how? How did that kind of come about?",routine,33_32,T,crq,
"Yeah, cost together and kind of went and studied at a coffee shop. Yeah. And then just kind of asked to, like, do a movie night. And I was like, chill and good. Nice. Ya know, like,",routine,33_33,P,cd,
"Yeah. Nice. Nice. That's great. Oh, I'm really happy. That's great. So, a lot of really nice things that are going on. Yeah, that's terrific. Yeah. So then for you to go like from, you know, because, you know, we kind of got going with this thing. It was kind of like, you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes twice a day, and now it'd be down to, you know, three, like in the space of like, you know, just like seven eight weeks is pretty remarkable. So no, I'm really pleased with how hard you've been working cuz you've really been pushing yourself. And I really appreciate it. I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard. It's hard for you",story,33_34,T,orq,
"is like not being able to, like I don't feel comfortable really telling her yet about.",routine,33_35,P,od,
"And you may not, you know, I mean it's like, you know, another we talked about there's like maybe there are times when you just don't really want to share some of that stuff. You know, and and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like, you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad. If you would want to share it, you'd want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like, like, Oh, yeah, you were so mean to me now have an eating disorder, you know, because then that that feels, you know, that doesn't feel quite right. And know that that's, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don't really feel like that. That's how you'd want that to go, you know? Yeah. And I know we've talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad? Yeah,",story,33_36,T,irq,
"yeah. Yeah, he's doing well, hoping that he's coming up here to school to see me once he plays a couple weeks. Great.",routine,33_37,P,id,
"So nice. They'll be really nice for you to spend time with them. That's great. That's really great. Yeah. So let's talk some more about this thing with your mom, because I feel like that. I mean, I know it's tough, but I guess I've been thinking about this a lot, especially after last session that that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke are so close, and it does feel like that your mom is, at least she seems like she's making she's trying to make an attempt to connect with you. Whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel like that you? Well, what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like, maybe not let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit. I mean, is there something is there something that like, if you could ask They're like, okay, mom, if you did this, then I would do this. Not that you would do that. But just wondering if like, what would you? ideally what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more.",story,33_38,T,irq,
"I mean, like, I wish she really recognized like, kind of the pressures that she put on me back in the day, huh? Yeah, and just like now to just know just kind of be there in the moment. So like, trying so hard to like, things still come out. Like she still makes her little comments that they.",symp/reasoning,33_39,P,id,
"Yeah, I know. We talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like that you could? Like, even let her know that. That that puts a lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings because I know that in the moment you feel it. But what would it be like for you if you were to just like, yeah, say like, you know, I know that you're I know that you mean Well, I mean, maybe she doesn't, but maybe it's sometimes important to approach it that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you know, I feel like that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way. And, you know,",story,33_40,T,irq,
"so I mean, I am seeing that I like starting to see that she does mean well.",symp/reasoning,33_41,P,id,
"right, because I know that you did that. You've done that with your roommate. I know there's been other times when people have done that. So I know that that's been kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you're feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that and you know, thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that every once in a while she kind of like jabs here, she'll send something out and and, and the way that you take it in is more like harsh, critical. You know her and, and I just don't know like color. It's kinda like with Kathy. When you Talk with her how it's like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course, like, you know, uh, you know, I'll try to be more sensitive and I'm not really sure. You know whether or not your mom would be.",story,33_42,T,orq,
"Yeah, I mean, I guess she could do. Yes, I worry that, because we've always been kind of defensive towards each other. I just worry that like, that will happen again. I mean, I don't know, like it might not because of things happen. Right. But",story,33_43,P,od,
"yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there are times when I wonder if like, maybe if there's a time when you say something, like, I know there have been times when you kind of snap back at her, you know, or you'll kind of like, you know, barber or kind of jabber a little bit. What if, you know, again, you What have you thought about like, because it sounds like that you're really aware when you do that? Because you know that when she says something, you have a tendency to jet back. You could just say, you know, You know, I realized I was I, that was a that was a jab at you. And I'm really sorry, I aware that that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I that doesn't I don't feel very good about that. Now I wonder how she would you know if, if that would, what that would do, maybe, maybe it wouldn't do anything or may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but you think about it, I mean, and you kind of Mull that over in your mind about what that might be like, because my experience has been that sometimes. You know, I hate the phrase, be a bigger person, because then you know, I didn't want that to come across that way. But sometimes in order to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like, kind of be willing to do something just a little different. And since it seems like you have a growing awareness of, you know, the interactions that you have with her I wonder if that might be worthwhile. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. mulling over and think about it and, and we'll keep talking about it. But yeah, sounds like it was a really terrific week and been working really hard it really pays off because again, the more you've done that we've seen real positive impact on your eating so nice",story,33_44,T,gt,
