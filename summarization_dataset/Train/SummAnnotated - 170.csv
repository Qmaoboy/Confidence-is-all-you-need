You don't feel like continuing with your life.,story,170_8,T,crq,
"Yeah, kind of",story,170_9,P,cd,
Have you been having thoughts of suicide?,story,170_10,T,yq,
"I mean, I think about what it would be like to just end things. I think it would be a lot easier. But at the same time, like, I can't imagine doing it. But you know, I can't say I haven't thought about it. ",story,170_11,P,id,
"So you have some thoughts about it, what prevents you from doing it?",symp/reasoning,170_12,T,irq,
"I don't know. I mean, I guess I know what it would be like for my family. I don't want to hurt them.",symp/reasoning,170_13,P,id,
They would be hurt?,symp/reasoning,170_14,T,crq,
"Yes and it's scary, I mean, the thought of dying is scary, but the thought of going on is painful.",symp/reasoning,170_15,P,cd,
So it almost sounds as if by squaring it down a bit.,symp/reasoning,170_16,T,id,
"Yeah, I kind of feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Like I just don't know where to go from here.",,170_17,P,id,
Have you worked out in a specific plan or so?,symp/reasoning,170_18,T,yq,
"No, I mean, you know, you know, I thought like if I were to do it, you know, ways but not not specific because I just don't think that I could do it, you know, like, I don't. I thought about suicide, but I don't like, seriously consider it as an option. But it's starting to like creep into my thoughts. And it never has before so that I'm like, kind of concerned about that. Like, I guess I know. Sometimes people like really planted and but for me, I've it's an I've never really considered it before so it's really scaryfor me. ",symp/reasoning,170_19,P,id,
"So, this how long been going on this feelings?",story,170_20,T,irq,
"Um, I think like in the past couple of days, it started you know, more so and then like today, it was just like the first thought in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about it and that's why I wanted to see you because I'm just feeling I'm starting to feel like a little bit out of control.",story,170_21,P,id,
"Okay, so and today and maybe the past few days been kind of new feeling that a new thought you don't want to continue life continue living. But at the same time, you don't want to commit suicide. You don't have a plan.",story,170_22,T,id,
"Yeah, I don't want to I, I really don't want to but, you know, like I said, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place like it. It's not, I know it's not a good option. I just like Sometimes I feel like I'm so stuck. I just don't know where else to go.",story,170_23,P,ack,
"So if, we'll call it feeling depression, right, because that's what we've talked about before, is the depression will go away? Do you think that would change your outlook on?",symp/reasoning,170_24,T,yq,
"Definitely, I think that is like the reason why I, the reason why the thought of not living anymore comes into my head is because of my depression because I just feel so like, my emotions are out of control, because I wake up feeling so down and so useless and pointless, that it makes me wish that I was dead. But if I didn't have that feeling, then I wouldn't wish that I was dead. Because I know that my life has value and I know that my family would want me around and I know there's a future for me, but my feelings make me feel like my future is just dark and pointless",symp/reasoning,170_25,P,id,
"Alright these suicidal ideations I know you're, you're telling me you haven't had them before, so I can appreciate that they're scary. They could be scary, even if you hadn't had them before, are fairly common with depression. And you've, it sounds like what you're really saying is you're frustrated, and you're tired of being sick. And I think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if you happen to regularly talk about your family before and it would seem to be very upset. When I see your life has value. I want to try to hang on to that thought. After we're done here today, tell me what you have planned for us today.",symp/reasoning,170_26,T,id,
"Well, I didn't I didn't really have plans because I kind of you know, came here feeling like I really needed to see you so I kind of put things on hold but I mean, I guess I would go home and, and, you know, I'm not really sure. ",symp/reasoning,170_27,P,id,
Anywhere else you will go?,symp/reasoning,170_28,T,yq,
"No. But, I mean, I probably could go to my parents house if I needed to, I could probably call them in and see, you know, it's getting close to the afternoon so they get off work soon.",symp/reasoning,170_29,P,on,
Can you do that for me? Can you go there?,symp/reasoning,170_30,T,yq,
"Yeah, I think that's a good idea.",symp/reasoning,170_31,P,op,
"And we'll kind of play by here from that point. I'm going to see you today. We'll we'll do some work today. Well, I'll see you again tomorrow. All right. So if you could spend a night there that that would be a wiser choice, given your thoughts and your feelings right now. Have you ever haven't used the term contract for safety?",symp/reasoning,170_32,T,irq,
I think you mentioned it before. I'm not really sure.,symp/reasoning,170_33,P,id,
"Okay. So what it means is you kind of an only if it's authentic, I want this to be true is kind of where you promised me that you're going to be safe until I see you again, right for the foreseeable future that you don't have any intent or plan to harm yourself. Can you make that promise to me now? ",routine,170_34,T,yq,
Yeah,routine,170_35,P,op,
