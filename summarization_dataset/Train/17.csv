Are you doing today?,inactive,17_0,T,gt,
"Okay, how are you? ",inactive,17_1,P,gt,
I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.,inactive,17_2,T,gt,
"Yes, um, I would like to be able to kind of I've been feeling a little depressed and I would really like to be able to reduce those depressed you know, the depression.",symp/reasoning,17_3,P,gc,
"So reduce feelings of depression. Yes, that'd be a cool okay. Yes. So Sounds like a good goal. So what objectives what tasks Do you think that you could do? That would help you to feel less depressed?",routine,17_4,T,irq,
"I guess maybe some sort of physical activity, maybe like walking. I like to be outside. So maybe walking could be one. Okay.",routine,17_5,P,id,
Have you had a plan before we have walked regularly?,routine,17_6,T,irq,
"You know, I used to. I did. And it was, it was, it was a it would give me some relief, because I was I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking. And so I Yes, yes, I've had success with walking before.",routine,17_7,P,id,
So Walking has worked before.,symp/reasoning,17_8,T,yq,
Yes.,inactive,17_9,P,ack,
And you notice that you're walking less since you've had a first impression. I,routine,17_10,T,crq,
"really haven't been doing too much of anything I've just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over doing getting homework done. Because I'm, you know, back in school, and it's been so stressful and overwhelming. You know, like I said, it's just kind of gotten me in this little funk, this depressed mood. So",story,17_11,P,cd,
"since you're on the topic of homework, which is something you think you can do there, you mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming. And that sounds like the type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes. Mm hmm. Do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is?",routine,17_12,T,orq,
"Yeah, because you know, is there's so much work to be done and sometimes a good you know, several assignments. Do And at the same time, and I find myself rushing to get assignments and and, you know, it can just be a little daunting. It's just overwhelming sometimes. So yeah. And I don't know, maybe if I spaced that out and, you know, took, you know, did some time management or something like that I don't know, to kind of help me",inactive,17_13,P,od,
feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due.,symp/reasoning,17_14,T,orq,
"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,17_15,P,od,
That's the feeling maybe of overwhelmed.,inactive,17_16,T,orq,
"Yes, I would say that.",inactive,17_17,P,od,
"So, yeah, you're right. It sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right. So if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier, and do it in small bits, okay. Instead of me waiting more or less the last minute, right. That would reduce the mean likely, I would think reduce some of the stressed feelings of being overwhelmed.",routine,17_18,T,ci,
I'm sure it would you sure would.,inactive,17_19,P,ack,
"So one, make that your sec objective then so you have the walking, okay. And then you'll have trying to space out the homework. ",routine,17_20,T,ci,
"Okay, that sounds doable",inactive,17_21,P,ack,
sound good. All right.,inactive,17_22,T,ack,
Yes.,inactive,17_23,P,ack,
What other objectives might work?,routine,17_24,T,orq,
Let's see.,inactive,17_25,P,od,
that worked in the past for you.,inactive,17_26,T,irq,
"You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing. And right now I feel like I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because I've been so busy doing work doing homework, so I think that would probably help.",routine,17_27,P,id,
So it's a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework,routine,17_28,T,yq,
Yes.,inactive,17_29,P,ack,
It has kind of come in the singing parts fun for it sounds like but also there's a social component seems like,routine,17_30,T,irq,
"Yes, it is. It is. Enjoy access to enjoy singing, and, you know, I enjoy the people that I was saying with and we will go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs or events, you know, different bands that were playing it you know, it'll just be nice. It's fun. I love music. So I love listening to it and I love you know, singing. So making music. So that was great. I think that would be a good goal.",routine,17_31,P,id,
You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing.,routine,17_32,T,orq,
"Yes, it's I I just love it. I enjoy doing it. And I just haven't had a chance to deal with lightning.",routine,17_33,P,od,
so far. This is justmaking the time.,routine,17_34,T,gc,
"Yes, yeah. Yes.",inactive,17_35,P,gc,
"Good. All right. So we'll make that the third objective. So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently. And then singing and that, that socializing, it's the companies that, that singing that's great. So three objectives is good. I try to get to four. If you have one. Is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you've associated with not feeling depressed when",symp/reasoning,17_36,T,orq,
"I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt. And so that's two things. The beach. I love the beach because it's soothing. It's company. And I, my, she's just such an awesome person and she's always pouring into me and I just love spending time with her. So she lives down to pitch.",story,17_37,P,od,
"Yes, she does. Okay, so this seems like a good, good objective to Yes. So you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often?",routine,17_38,T,irq,
"Yes. Again, just at home doing homework, and I haven't gone to visit her in a while. And the thing is, she only lives like an hour away. So it's not a it's not right. No, it's not. So that's like a, you know, a trip I couldn't do on a Saturday. Take a break and go down there and spend some time with that will be I think that will be helpful.",routine,17_39,P,id,
"So again, kind of kind of getting away from the school stressors. Just take taking a break from it for a day. Yes. And then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with. Good. Good. All right. So I want to go through each one of these. And just make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do, but these are all specific, which is good. Do you feel these are all achievable? These are things you can do. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, someone that knew done in the past, right, ",routine,17_40,T,gc,
right.,inactive,17_41,P,gc,
"So now we have the specific and the achievable. I don't want to get too personal and more tricky, which is making it measurable. I like to do here. I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives. I want you to decide. But I want to see We can quantify, in some manner, how often you'll be able to do these different things or how, you know, quite like a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but, but first with the walking. So in a given week, say what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking? How many times?",routine,17_42,T,irq,
"Um, maybe I can start out with twice a week, twice quickly.",routine,17_43,P,id,
Okay. Do you have two particular days in line days for your responsibilities aren't too great. You have that opportunity?,routine,17_44,T,irq,
Maybe we need to start with one day a week.,routine,17_45,P,id,
"Okay. Let's go one day, one time, one time a week. Let's talk with one and then we'll see what happens.",routine,17_46,T,orq,
"Okay, ",inactive,17_47,P,od,
so what day of the week are you thinking?,routine,17_48,T,orq,
About Monday?,routine,17_49,P,od,
Consider a window of opportunity you see on Monday.,routine,17_50,T,irq,
"It is. Yeah. Plus, it just kind of, I think, no, no. How about Wednesday? ",routine,17_51,P,id,
Wednesday?,routine,17_52,T,orq,
"Yes. Wednesday, middle of the week. Stress from work and school and yes, Wednesday. Sounds good.",routine,17_53,P,od,
"Once you have a particular time range, you like to walk a few times a day,",routine,17_54,T,irq,
like 6:30.,routine,17_55,P,id,
"That's a good time for you. As the time you can get out of house,",routine,17_56,T,crq,
"yes, off work. And give me a little bit of time to get home and change and out the door. Because if I, if I make it too late, I'm not going to go",routine,17_57,P,cd,
"6:30 is kind of a good, that's a good time. Yeah. 630 good. So we'll start with that objective. The Walking Every Wednesday at 630 for every amount of time are comfortable with. So, the homework is a little trickier, right? This is about spacing it out. Okay? So the homework assignments, they're stressing you out. How much time did they take? Last few few questions. How much time do they take to complete? Generally? Like an hour? So",story,17_58,T,irq,
it depends on the assignment.,inactive,17_59,P,id,
If you had the average of,inactive,17_60,T,irq,
the average two hours,symp/reasoning,17_61,P,id,
"let's go to worst case, let's go two and a half hours just to cover code worst case will generally be the worst case.",inactive,17_62,T,orq,
"Maybe it depends, because",inactive,17_63,P,od,
"when we get three, ",inactive,17_64,T,orq,
"yeah, the second",inactive,17_65,P,od,
"two to three hours, okay. And then how much time do you have when it's assigned to when it's due usually",symp/reasoning,17_66,T,irq,
Maybe a couple of weeks.,inactive,17_67,P,id,
A couple weeks. Yeah.,symp/reasoning,17_68,T,orq,
"I get distracted. So a little distracted. So it's, you know, I start reading and I'll fall asleep or I get distracted by something. And then before you know it, the time is gone. And I'm rushing at the end to get it shown up to try and get it all done.",story,17_69,P,od,
"So I was ready to do the work to ease into the last Okay, yeah, I could see how that would be stressful. what day of the week isn't usually a Sunday.",routine,17_70,T,irq,
On Tuesdays on Tuesdays.,routine,17_71,P,id,
"So you have Tuesday, and then you have another Tuesday and the week after that, you have three hours of work. And those two weeks.",routine,17_72,T,crq,
shipping. Okay?,routine,17_73,P,cd,
"Yeah, will be the first day and time but kind of like when you specified Wednesday 630 that's gonna be a walking time, right right at the time, and you can start the homework because the first time",routine,17_74,T,ci,
I'm come back from my walk on Wednesdays.,routine,17_75,P,ack,
How long do you foresee,routine,17_76,T,irq,
"Well, normally only half an hour.",routine,17_77,P,id,
"So to get some time to decompress and round Alright, so from eight to nine on Tuesday, or Wednesday, on Wednesday, you'll get the first third of the homework. And then and then just stop. Okay, that'd be that'd be done for the night. Okay. All right. That's some big plans. How about that second hour?",routine,17_78,T,orq,
I'll get started.,routine,17_79,P,od,
"Thursday, so it's just one day apart.",routine,17_80,T,crq,
"Yeah, that's due Thursday.",routine,17_81,P,cd,
"Oh, do come Thursday. Yeah. an hour. Yes. And what hour do you have in mind?",routine,17_82,T,irq,
Thursday's,routine,17_83,P,id,
"So but 7070 so one night, Wednesday be at nine o'clock. And then on Thursday, seven nine was two hours. Seven days. Sorry. Okay. So now just the last hour remains",routine,17_84,T,irq,
"Sunday, Sunday",routine,17_85,P,id,
"through Sunday. Okay. So you you want to get everything done from Tuesday to Sunday night? Yeah, the rest of that time off. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Sure that's achievable. That seems like you're, you're getting a lot in there, but you think you can do it?",routine,17_86,T,orq,
"I can try. Okay. Yeah,",routine,17_87,P,od,
"that sounds good. All right. What time Sunday,",routine,17_88,T,crq,
Sunday around five,routine,17_89,P,cd,
"to five to six, five to six.",routine,17_90,T,crq,
Yes.,inactive,17_91,P,cd,
"And I'm assuming it won't run over because we kind of have to be on the high side, but if it did, I would be able to go five to seven So that's kind of like, yeah, flexible time there. Yes. So what would that feel like to get your homework done?",story,17_92,T,irq,
But it would be a relief.,symp/reasoning,17_93,P,id,
"Okay. So, and there's a potential backup plan I see in here is that if something happens on Sunday, where you need more time, and you don't want to stress, you still have that Wednesday after you walk bacon. Yeah. So that could be like your, your backup. Yes, that makes sense. Yes. Because you still have another six days to have done after that. Right. All right. So all those seem realistic and achievable.",inactive,17_94,T,yq,
It does.,inactive,17_95,P,ack,
Every so many Fridays.,inactive,17_96,T,crq,
every friday,inactive,17_97,P,cd,
"So, so this is this isn't every Friday commitment. Right, this thing?",routine,17_98,T,irq,
Yeah. But one Friday is generally it's maybe,routine,17_99,P,id,
"about two hours, two hours. So two hours every Friday. There's something really enjoyed though. So and it sounds like you look forward to it. Yeah. So Friday, two hours, I guess. Yes. afternoon or evening. Evening. Okay.",story,17_100,T,ci,
"Yeah, I mean, if I if it was something that came up that I really had to get done is not like I can't not go. So it won't be managed, right?",inactive,17_101,P,ack,
"Yeah. Good. Okay. So that was the last objective this is. This is I guess about a whole day commitment, right? Because you go to the beach, it's an hour drive, so you probably wouldn't want to go down for just a few hours. More like the whole day, would they?",symp/reasoning,17_102,T,orq,
"That would be more like a Saturday. But of course, it wouldn't be every Saturday.",story,17_103,P,od,
"So how many times and say a month, like once? Once a month? Okay. So you go down on Saturday morning and come back?",story,17_104,T,irq,
Yes.,inactive,17_105,P,id,
"That's something to look forward to. Yes. Is that something that would be okay, in terms of like, because on Friday night, potentially, you'd be out. Right and then Saturday.",routine,17_106,T,orq,
"Yeah, if I, if all those Saturdays that I know that I'm going I could not be out too late on that.",routine,17_107,P,od,
"Okay, that's a good idea. So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out? Yes. When you know that Saturday is coming",routine,17_108,T,irq,
"or not go at all, that's fine. Either way,",routine,17_109,P,id,
"just take a break that time. Yes. Restore. All right. So that's four separate objectives. And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment just take a break, and print this up for you. Okay, we'll work on the rest of your goals next time but I want you to have this so you can get started on it right away. So before I print these up as a changes you want to make",story,17_110,T,ci,
"um, I would like to try that",inactive,17_111,P,ack,
"And if it doesn't work, can we tweak? Oh yeah, we can always make changes. Maybe certain things will work really well. It Certain things, we'll have to take off the list altogether, maybe substitute something else. Yeah, we can, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here. Okay, we can just make a document that changes as as needed. But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go and print this up as it is, and give you a copy and we can resume with today's session. And then next time I see in a week, or call the rest of the treatment plan. Beside the plan, yes. Thanks, Allison. ",routine,17_112,T,irq,
Thank you.,inactive,17_113,P,gt,
summary,"The patient has felt a little depressed and wish to reduce those feelings. The patient has been stressing out doing homework and walking has helped them before to give some relief. The therapist clarifies organizing homework differently in small bits will help instead of last minute. The patient enjoys singing as it is a social activity. The patient also loves going to the beach and visiting their aunt. The therapist works out a plan with the patient. The plan is to walk every wednesday at 6:30 for the amount of time they are comfortable with. The patient would take three hours at max to complete their homework. The plan discussed is to do homework on wednesday right after the walk, then on Thursday and Sunday. The patient agrees all those feel realistic and achievable. The patient also adds a two hour plan on Friday evenings which is not every Friday. The therapist finally adds the whole day commitment to drive down to aunt's place once a month on any saturday. The therapist documents this plan and would review in the next session in a week.",,,,
