Yeah.,inactive,6_2,P,ack,
Can you tell me about what's been going on?,inactive,6_3,T,irq,
"Yeah. For the past, past, maybe a couple weeks, I guess few weeks. I have these morning meetings once a week at work, and I have to make a presentation. And every time I go to present, it's my turn and I start getting. Start getting really nervous.",symp/reasoning,6_4,P,id,
"Start getting really nervous. So your morning meeting at work. And so does each person at the meeting present in like, a row?",symp/reasoning,6_5,T,yq,
" Yeah, yeah, we all take turn,",symp/reasoning,6_6,P,ack,
"they'll take turns. And when you start to feel nervous, when it's your time to talk or before or after that, and now",story,6_7,T,crq,
"I'm usually the guy at the start of the meeting, because I know I'm gonna have to, there's about 10 of us and I always seem to be one of the last few to go like, like six or seven, kind of in line to present",story,6_8,P,cd,
"says around 10 people at the meeting. Yeah. And and as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end. So can you describe what's happening say for the beginning of the meeting, in terms of what you're experiencing?",story,6_9,T,crq,
"Hmm. Sowhen I walk in, I'm usually okay and you know, say good morning to everybody and then my my boss calls means order. And that's usually when it starts, like kind of starts like, maybe like butterflies in my stomach kinda. And then after he makes his report, and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to be faster, my palms get sweaty, and I just, I just start to feel really nervous. I've realized that I might be kind of I start to tune out some of the other presentations. Because I, I start to become focused on how I'm feeling.",symp/reasoning,6_10,P,cd,
And I focused focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you're not really hearing what they're saying.,symp/reasoning,6_11,T,yq,
"Yeah, ",symp/reasoning,6_12,P,ack,
"they're saying, ",inactive,6_13,T,gc,
"Yeah, ",inactive,6_14,P,gc,
"all right. So go on. So So these you have these physical symptoms, this nervousness, what happens and ",symp/reasoning,6_15,T,crq,
yeah,inactive,6_16,P,cd,
"By the time it it's my turn to present I start. I just, I'm almost like just almost shaking. Yeah, I noticed that my hands are a little little off. And so keep my hands down, like in my lap and just that. I don't want anybody to see them shaking like that. And I have a paper in front of me that I just kind of read from. But when I start reading my my voice is a little shaky, and I kind of stutter and tripped over my words. And I just I feel like I'm not making good presentations and then it's not looking good to my boss.",story,6_17,P,cd,
"So, so in the moment when you're when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness like that doesn't that doesn't go away at all. And you're trying to hold your body kind of still. Like like almost a cube control. ",symp/reasoning,6_18,T,orq,
"Yeah, ",symp/reasoning,6_19,P,od,
"yeah. And then your voice This kind of sounds like crackly or breaking up as you're trying to read from like, bullet points like wanna? ",symp/reasoning,6_20,T,yq,
"Yeah, ",inactive,6_21,P,ack,
like an outline?,symp/reasoning,6_22,T,crq,
Yeah.,inactive,6_23,P,cd,
What happens when you have read the last read last point?,symp/reasoning,6_24,T,irq,
"Well when I'm done it's it takes a little bit for everything to calm down. But I I'm, then I'm consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he's, you know, he's regretting putting me in this position and that I can't make good records or you know that I didn't report the right stuff the right information to him and and so, it doesn't really go away. It just it's almost like my mind is shift someone I'm anxious about.",story,6_25,P,id,
"Alright, so then the nervousness that's stronger feeling of nervousness that goes away, is replaced by a more general feeling. nervousness about how your how your boss will think of you. Yeah. Because of the presentation quality. ",story,6_26,T,gc,
Yeah.,story,6_27,P,ack,
"Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that. And you're aware of that. ",story,6_28,T,crq,
Yeah.,story,6_29,P,cd,
"How How long have you noticed? This, these symptoms that appear in this way.",routine,6_30,T,crq,
"Um, when you when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time, and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations. And I just, I mean, most people are afraid of public speaking so like half out that maybe that's what it was. So you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn't really didn't really bother me letters. I figured it was just normal and always got you know, decent grades. On my presentation so it never really bothered me. So I really feel like it's only been an issue in the last few weeks.",symp/reasoning,6_31,P,cd,
The last few weeks is when you notice that we had we had some nervousness before presenting in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal generally impair your ability to present an effect your grades or anything right.,symp/reasoning,6_32,T,orq,
Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on?,inactive,6_33,T,crq,
"Um I'm not sure if it if it has any bearing. My my mom, she, she I know she doesn't like to speak in public. And I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations. School and, you know, shoots Oh, you can buy it on. It's tiny. And, you know, so I don't know if that means anything.",story,6_34,P,cd,
"So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe, maybe she has that going on to ",routine,6_35,T,orq,
maybe,inactive,6_36,P,od,
"the same, same set of symptoms, at least.",story,6_37,T,orq,
"Yeah. I mean, I've asked her, you know, I've told her about this. And she hasn't been in a situation where she's had to, to do this kind of presentations, like in a small group like this. And so I don't, I can't compare it to that. But I mean, she has said that she's gotten nervous before.",story,6_38,T,od,
Any feelings of sadness or anything like that?,routine,6_39,T,irq,
"Yeah, like after I do after I make the presentation at work, and then I do start feeling really sad. You know, like I said, because then I feel like my boss isn't satisfied with my performance and that he's gonna regret his decision to give me this position. And so yeah, it definitely makes me sad. I feel disappointed in myself.",story,6_40,P,id,
"Do you have any substance use going on alcohol, anything else?",symp/reasoning,6_41,T,irq,
And now I have a drink every now and then it's very very rare,symp/reasoning,6_42,P,id,
"and in these I know this is something recent for you but in these meetings so far, has the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn?",symp/reasoning,6_43,T,crq,
"No, no, I've I've managed to control it, I guess to where I can stay there. Like I said, I've kind of zoned out some times when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel like they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I'd become focused on on on what's going on inside like my heart eating and the you know, my hands and so I can't I zone out on them sometimes, but But no, I I pushed through it and I do my presentation.",story,6_44,P,cd,
Are you ever worried about what they're thinking about? She mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you ever worried about what the other workers at the table thinking about?,story,6_45,T,crq,
"Yeah, times cuz I feel like you know I'm the newest member of the management team and so I feel like they're kinda like what is up with this chick? I can't she get it together but you know there's there's been one person who's been really supportive and you know, she's been like, Hey, you did great today and great information and things like that. So that kind of helps me feel better. But I guess at the end of the day to me, it's really my boss's opinion that matters because he's my boss.",story,6_46,P,cd,
"Have you ever felt you mentioned you're nervous at the beginning of the meeting? Have you ever felt nervous? well in advance of the meeting,",symp/reasoning,6_47,T,crq,
"I'm when I'm preparing Like that morning to go to work, and that's one of those like, Okay, I got this meeting at nine. And I start to think about I like on my way into work and but I don't, I don't start feeling anything until I'm actually in the room.",symp/reasoning,6_48,P,cd,
"So have you noticed nervousness, fairly intense? Pretty much only at these meetings. It's been bothering you for a few weeks. something new, something a little frightening for you. We'll get you set up with treatment. I'll get you in to see somebody in next few days. If that works for you. ",routine,6_49,T,gc,
"Yeah, that'd be great. ",inactive,6_50,P,op,
