"Well, I could see these types of decisions where you're talking about potentially breaking families up and having real consequences to families. I could see how these decisions could be. I'm sure there's guidelines you are supposed to follow that you really don't have a whole lot of choice in. But you could also really agonize and overanalyze a decision like that because the consequences are so great. Maybe somehing that could be happening.",symp/reasoning,34_0,T,id,
"Yeah, I think so. I mean, you're right. To a certain extent, we have guidelines and everything like that. But I also feel like certain things, it just isn't black and white, and I have to make a judgment call. And I used to trust my judgment, but now I feel like how do I know that I'm making the right decisions?",story,34_1,P,id,-2
"Yeah. Well, and this is really the one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress. We talked about this insecurity. You're on this I'm sure. And so you know, one question may be, did you make a efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family but the larger question is, you as a person can you can you do this, this job and if you do it and make money Like, what would you do then? Could you go through this again?",story,34_2,T,id,
"Yeah, I think that's where the fear is, is that if 99 times out of 100 I do it right, there's still gonna be that one that I messed up. And I'm starting to feel like that one mistake could be like, life changing for somebody.",symp/reasoning,34_3,P,id,-2
"And it could be you certainly in a job where, like, most jobs where mistakes have consequences. You also do a lot of good for a lot of people. So by you not being in the field. They're not getting the benefit of the skills you have.",story,34_4,T,id,
"I guess that's true. Like, yeah, maybe somebody else could come and replace me but do I think that they would be better at it? I don't know. I feel like I was pretty good at it before I started. have all these doubt.",story,34_5,P,id,
"So, so mostly This was good until recently. Well, alright, let's look at this from another point of view. You really seem like, you can empathize with these families. You really, to me, it seems like you really know what they're feeling.",routine,34_6,T,id,

"and appreciating their perspective. Take a moment and try to walk in their shoes. If a professional like yourself came to you and your family situation and maybe you're engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family we've broken up temporarily. What would you want? How would you want them to process that? Like you said, thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family? How would you want them to feel that? Would you want them to process that decision?",story,34_8,T,irq,
"I don't know. That's a hard question. I mean, if they took my kids away, even if it was the right thing, I would want them to be at least a little bit, you know, feel a little bit bad about having to make such a hard decision. But I guess if, you know, if they fell apart, every time that they made that kind of decision, they wouldn't be able to help other people.",story,34_9,P,id,
"So from the family's point of view, if you're in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do. Well, you'd like to have some compassion for you. Okay, that seems reasonable. Yeah. So now flip back into the role you're in. You made the decision you had to make although you're second guessing it That's separate. Do you have compassion for them?",story,34_10,T,id,
" Yeah, I mean, I think that might be the problem is I have too much of it. You know, I worry about how they feel, even if maybe taking the kids away was the right thing. It's just like so devastating. To lose your kids, whether you're doing the right things or not, you know, you want your kids with you. You want to be able to take care of them, even if you're not doing a really good job at it.",story,34_11,P,id,-1
