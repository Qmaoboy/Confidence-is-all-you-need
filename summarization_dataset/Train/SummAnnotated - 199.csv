"Well, that's the housekeeping finish with Kathleen. So perhaps you'd like to tell me a bit about what brings you here today?",symp/reasoning,199_0,T,irq,
"Well, actually, Wendy, I'm having a lot of trouble coping with with my job. The hours are working are supposed to be 830 to 330. And lately, I've just got so much work given to me. I'm having difficulty getting through the whole day with it. And I've got a couple of teenage boys that I pick up after school every day because he's so naughty. They're not allowed to go on the bus. And so I've made my hours 830 to 330. So I give them a chance to Get out of school and then at 330 on on supposed to be there to pick them up. But lately, it's been later and later on getting there sometimes 430 the other day was five and the boys were just the naughty boys you notice and and they're everywhere. They're all over the school they're getting into trouble and and then I'm late home preparing dinner for my husband and then he gets annoyed and on it goes, it's getting too much. ",symp/reasoning,199_1,P,id,
So you're supposed to finish at 330 Why do you think you're not finishing it through 330?,symp/reasoning,199_2,T,irq,
too much work? And here's what's happening. We'll we'll do one dog work in a doctor's surgery. I don't know if I mentioned that. One doctor employed me but there are four within the practice. And I'm doing work for all of them when really I should only be doing work for one,symp/reasoning,199_3,P,id,
"right, So that's really the problem that we'll get You work and there's no way you can fit into the the times that you were employed to work. ",symp/reasoning,199_4,T,id,
"No. And I just can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray. And then and then it's not get into my head try and write those fallen. It's there the next day in. And it's It's just all too much for us. ",routine,199_5,P,on,
I can see that I can see you're getting quite stressed about it. So have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this? Kathleen? Is there anything you think you could do?,routine,199_6,T,yq,
"Well, apart from just I don't I don't believe it's such a good job, but I'll probably have to, I'll have to, I'll have to tell some. I'll have to tell her. I think I'm gonna have to tell her ",symp/reasoning,199_7,P,id,
so you really do feel that you need to talk to the boss that includes you and explain what the problem is. Is this something you feel comfortable about doing?,symp/reasoning,199_8,T,yq,
"No, no, no, no. Oh, she's easy and And she is lovely and I just thought I don't I don't want to annoy her. ",symp/reasoning,199_9,P,on,
"Okay, because she was lovely there. She says, Do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her, that she'd actually be quite receptive to listening to you?",routine,199_10,T,yq,
"Well, of course she, wouldn't she",routine,199_11,P,id,
"okay. What I'm going to suggest Kathleen is that we do something called a role play. And what that is, is that we act out the situation, whatever it is. And in your case, it's going to be you going and talking to your boss and trying to explain to her that you've got a problem trying to fit your work into the house, which is supposed to be working. So you'll be playing, you end up playing your boss. Now, obviously, you're not going to get exactly the same responses from your boss that you'll get from me today. But it does give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it, to practice it, and to get a response that you can then react to and practice your way through a possible scenario. And what this could do happily Give you a bit more confidence about the swing. ",routine,199_12,T,id,
What do you put in a?,routine,199_13,P,irq,
"Well, we practice it right now. Oh, I can, what we'll do is, you'll be you. And I'll be the doctor that you're going to see. Let's just think about a couple of things to get it started.",routine,199_14,T,id,
"So I pretend that I'm going to be coming into her tutorial. Okay, ",routine,199_15,P,id,
"well, what do you think would be the best time of day to do it? Oh, topic day",routine,199_16,T,irq,
"time of day. I'm so busy so busy during the day, I'm probably early morning might be the best first first thing in the morning. ",routine,199_17,P,id,
Sounds like a good idea because then you don't have to worry.,routine,199_18,T,id,
That's true.,routine,199_19,P,ack,
"Okay, so have you had any got any thoughts about what you might say? How are you going to introduce?",routine,199_20,T,irq,
"I suppose I could say to her, is this a good time to talk? ",routine,199_21,P,id,
That's fantastic.,inactive,199_22,T,ack,
Okay,inactive,199_23,P,op,
"because that gives her the chance the opportunity to say well, No, it isn't. Could you come in five minutes. I'm sorry. Oh, Go straight into it. That's really good. Okay. Should we give it a try? ",inactive,199_24,T,yq,
Okay. All right.,inactive,199_25,P,op,
"So I'm gonna get you to stand up and pretend that you knocking on the doors that what you do. Yes, yes. All right. So I want you to get out and just do that and then come back in as if you're having to see your boss and the boss to tell me what to ",routine,199_26,T,id,
do the role plays out.,routine,199_27,P,id,
yeah,inactive,199_28,T,ack,
Okay. Now good time to talk.,inactive,199_29,P,id,
"Yeah, sure. Good, thank you.",inactive,199_30,T,ack,
"Well, the problem is Marianne on on having I'm having problems coping with my workload at the moment, mainly because it's putting me here, too late in the afternoon. Remember when you first put me on miles were 830 to 330 as well. No, I'm finishing later and later 430, sometimes 5 I've got too much work and a lot to finish on time because I have to pick them up from school and you know what they like. So I'm just wondering if if we can work well ",symp/reasoning,199_31,P,id,
"obviously you're employed 830 to 330  Kathlleine hours we want you to work so we don't want you working back so first of all, this is important that you know that we want you to leave at 330 and that's what I want you to do. But from what you're saying the work you're being given doesn't fit into those hours",symp/reasoning,199_32,T,id,
I don't know,routine,199_33,P,on,
what's happening here I'm getting too much work from the other doctors,routine,199_34,T,id,
All right i don't know i don't think you're not but I didn't think that I'd be getting work of four because this doctors here and is only doing your work.,symp/reasoning,199_35,P,id,
I think I've got the picture.,routine,199_36,T,od,
I don't I don't like saying no to them though.,symp/reasoning,199_37,P,od,
"I'm glad you came to me. I really need this job. Look. I'm really glad you came to see But obviously 830 to 330 is not enough. It's a long day, early as you're supposed to work. So I need to have a look into this and see what's going on. ",routine,199_38,T,id,
"It's only half my day. The other half starts when I pick my boys up. And they say naughty they are they are really well, certainly",symp/reasoning,199_39,P,id,
"Kathleen. Yes, I'll have a look at it. But I want you to make sure that you do leave at 330 every day.",routine,199_40,T,id,
"Well, I think because I've done that little rolle play feel a little bit better probably gone and seen the doctor will  help",routine,199_41,P,id,
"Obviously the responses that I gave are not going to be the ones you'll get from doctor because she is sure this is what she said she. So there'll be something similar, but the important thing is, I think, to work out that first opening gambit, isn't it and it's true and to do that, and then flow on so That's something I want you to think about. Perhaps a few. You guys come and see me next week and about a week perhaps.",routine,199_42,T,ack,
I have to sit home.,routine,199_43,P,id,
"Well, let's look at it. What I'd like you to do is think about what we've done today. Yes, but but don't don't. Don't overdo it don't sort of keep it down for your mind. Well, exactly. That's what I was going to say. I can see that you're getting a bit, too.",routine,199_44,T,id,
I don't like confrontation. I don't like telling people what to do.,routine,199_45,P,od,
"I know. Yeah. So having the right words is a help. That will help you to get a bit of confidence there. But importantly, I think we need to relax a bit, don't we? And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you that I'd like you to go away and practice. So that horrified by next week when you come, you'll practice those relaxation exercises, because they have things that you can use anyway in any situation. I'll tell you what I know you don't have to lie on the floor. Not for these because that's not very practical before you go see your boss. So, what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week's time and your practice the relaxation exercises, we'll go through them again, and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real. What do you think? ",routine,199_46,T,id,
"Okay, that's that sounds good. I feel a little bit more relaxed just thinking about that actually.",symp/reasoning,199_47,P,id,
summary,"One doctor employed patient but there are four within the practice . I just can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray . It's just all too much for patient. therapist suggest patient to relax a bit. and tells some relaxation exercises. ",,,,
