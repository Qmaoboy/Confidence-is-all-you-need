P,"Um, it's just kind of a throbbing pain, it'll act up kind of randomly throughout the day. It doesn't it's not specific to, you know, the morning or evening, or even in the middle of the day or night. It just kind of randomly acts up. I would say excessively, like when I'm doing work, like after the dishes will start to act up. If I, you know, lift one of my children up, it'll start to act up. So any sort of exertion is kind of where I've noticed a lot of the pain coming from",symp/reasoning,,id,

T,"Okay. Umm I would like to hear about a little bit about the severity of it on a pain scale of one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had one or zero being no pain at this, How bad is this pain?",symp/reasoning,,irq,
P,I would measure it probably six or seven. It's become more of a nuisance than an actual physical pain.,symp/reasoning,,id,
T,Okay. And is it a six or seven all the time?,routine,,yq,
P,"Um, whenever it starts to act up, yes. ",routine,,id,
T,Okay. And how often a day does that happen?,symp/reasoning,,irq,

P,No.,symp/reasoning,,on,
T,Okay. All righty. And can you point exactly to Where it is for me the location exactly?,symp/reasoning,,irq,
P,Kind of the area that just kind of wraps around the actual elbow than it is really bothering me.,symp/reasoning,,id,
T,And does that pain go up your arm or down your arm or anywhere else on your arm?,symp/reasoning,,yq,
P,No It stays right in that area.,symp/reasoning,,id,
T,Is there anything else that goes on at the same time? Any other symptoms that happen anything else other than when the pain is happening there anything else going on for you?,symp/reasoning,,yq,
P,"Not that I've noticed, No.",symp/reasoning,,on,

P,I whatever it says on the bottle usually wanted to tablet,routine,,id,

T,Have you seen anybody else for this complaint?,routine,,yq,
P,"Um, no. ",routine,,on,
T,Have you What else have you tried other than the Tylenol and anything else?,symp/reasoning,,irq,
P,"Um, I've attempted to use a heating pad on it. And I've also attempted ice. Neither were successful. ",symp/reasoning,,id,
T,"Okay. It sounds you've talked a little bit about how it's impacted, you know, you to be able to work in the garage or do the dishes or lift your child is there Other impact on your life,",symp/reasoning,,crq,

T,"All right. What I'd like to do now is just kind of go through all the things that you told me and summarize for you.

",routine,,id,
P,Okay.,inactive,,ack,
T,"You came to the clinic today for a complaint of left elbow pain, and it's pain that you mostly noticed when you were bending it or using it in some capacity. It's a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day, which you notice about is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that's when it seems to be at its worst. It's gone on for about a week, maybe two, two weeks when you think back on it, and it started out when you were helping your husband clean the garage and you were lifting locks of boxes. So about a six to seven on a pain scale. And you describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it's getting kind of in the way of doing some things that you want to you report that it happens probably two to three times a day, and that the pain wraps around the joint. Completely, you've taken some Tylenol for it across the counter, you've taken that several times a day now with without much relief",symp/reasoning,,id,
P,right,inactive,,ack,
T,"that it hasn't helped much. You've also tried a heating pad, you've tried some ice, that hasn't really helped either too much. It sounds like you know, again, you kept referring to it as an as a nuisance. It's just kind of getting in the way of your daily activities. It Doesn't necessarily keep you up at night. But you do notice it at night when you wake up that it's still going on for you. So sleep doesn't seem to help much. And that what you mostly think this could be is a pulled muscle of some type. Is there anything I forgotten or that you wanted to tell me about this?",symp/reasoning,,yq,
P,I'm not that I can think of no.,inactive,,on,
T,Thank you for telling me about your chief concerns. So I'm going to take it back to Dr. Smith.,inactive,,gt,
P,Thank you very much.,inactive,,gt,
