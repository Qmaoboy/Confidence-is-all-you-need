Does it worry that there's notes?,routine,91_38,T,yq,0
"Yes, because I might trust you. And I don't know if I do yet. But I don't trust the other people who work here because I don't know if they're working for the government, which they probably are working for the government. So they can actually have access to all of my notes and the things that you're writing down, which I don't know what they are, because you're not going to give me a copy of it yet.

"Well, because I made my room at home government proof, I think they're going to try to steal that technology when I actually create it so that they can then disrupt my room and then everybody else's rooms who are just like mine so that they can then use their mind control to then control me to do the things that they want me to do.",story,91_41,P,id,0
"So without the protection that your house offers, they could control your mind.",story,91_42,T,crq,0

Are you worried that something is going to happen a similar will happen on the bus?,routine,91_50,T,yq,0

"While people don't understand what's going on, then that's their fault. that's their problem. They should have listened to me. And I could actually gave them the technology that they needed to actually create the room so that the government can't hear them.",story,91_53,P,id,0
