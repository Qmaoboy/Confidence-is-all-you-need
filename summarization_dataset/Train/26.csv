"All right, great. So this one of the things I wanted to talk with you about is I know that you did some assessments over the last couple of days. And so I want to talk with you about that and just talk with you about kind of treatment and how things are going to go. And based on that sounds like the what, from what you were saying in terms of the assessment process that you have an eating disorder, it's called bulimia nervosa, and I'm not sure if you've ever heard of that.",symp/reasoning,26_2,T,irq,
"I mean, a little bit yeah. Okay.",inactive,26_3,P,id,
"So what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit. So what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you've lost control and you feel, you know, like overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly. And there are times to when you, you know, you're maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight. And that feel familiar to you. Yeah. So and then it sounds like that's been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week.",story,26_4,T,irq,
"I, I'd say, Yeah. All right.",inactive,26_5,P,id,
"So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not unusual. For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this. In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, so it's not unusual. One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting. So like going for long periods of time without eating and sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively. Yeah,",routine,26_6,T,irq,
especially when I was younger.,inactive,26_7,P,id,
"One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle. And we know that that's the case. The other thing that we're aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report a lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they're feeling or managing feelings. Is that something that you've experienced? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that's okay. Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that. And so we know that there's a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc. So one of the things that I like to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals like yourself is I take an approach it's called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there's a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you've been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake. And so what I'd like to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you've had, you know, overeating episodes and when you've restricted your calories, when you've You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things like that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we'll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we're together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating. So how's that sound? Okay. And there's really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we're going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you'll you'll know pretty quickly that you're gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it'll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating. Okay, great. So this is what I'd like to do is first of all, first of all, let's start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where like just recently within the last couple days where you've had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that. And then what I'd like to do is and we'll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that. So and then then what we'll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we'll, we'll start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present. And I'll just ask you a lot of questions and we'll, you know, kind of go from there. Right? So why don't you tell me the Tell me like a recent episode, that where you felt like that you'd lost control. You're eating",story,26_8,T,irq,
"me like just this Saturday night, I guess. I went out with my friends. And it was fun. It was a good night at first and whatnot. And we then went to a party.

So I kind of left pretty early on and went home or back to my apartment. And yeah, I mean, kind of what typically happens is the kitchen grabbing different foods bag of chips. I think my roommate had left out like a sleeve of cookies or something and, and I just ate on the couch. Yeah. Finished most of it and yeah.",story,26_9,P,id,

know with my mom more we moved to a different area okay not too far from my dad I saw him like a decent amount but definitely was with my mom more,story,26_61,P,id,
okay so then you alright so then Bruce your mom and Bruce in the you because I know you're seeing more time with her moved to what like a different different town different,routine,26_62,T,irq,
"I just like a town over okay, but change schools and whatnot.",routine,26_63,P,id,

switch or private school? Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. How was that transition for you going from public school to private school?,routine,26_66,T,irq,
"I mean, I wasn't excited about it. It was kind of like a more uppity area. Yeah, I mean, like, it was kind of hard, because they're like, like in a private school, these people have kind of been together for a little while. And because there's less people there, they kind of moreso all know each other and have their groups and whatnot.",story,26_67,P,id,
"Okay. And so then that would have been in around the time when you were 1213 when you made that move. Okay, so then, sounds like to that that was the time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating.",symp/reasoning,26_68,T,irq,
"Yeah, I think I like started. Mate, and I felt like more pressure from my mom. She was very vocal. towards me about my eating and my looks and whatnot.",symp/reasoning,26_69,P,id,

happy let them know that I didn't like the school.,routine,26_75,P,cd,

"I just like, oh, you should feel lucky. Like it's good school. Okay.",routine,26_77,P,id,
"Okay. Well, so many ways, like, one might be putting words your mouth, but what like, kind of get over it or like deal with it or, okay. So and so then you were feeling pressure from her sounds like also to that you weren't really feeling like that they were really that maybe there wasn't as much concern about your feelings about where you were. Was there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in terms of like, kind of the Get over it? You know that?",routine,26_78,T,irq,
"I mean, you mean in terms of the schooler? My body?",inactive,26_79,P,id,
"No, you're in terms of the school.",routine,26_80,T,irq,
"I mean, like get over it, like, it will get better with time. Like you just have to put yourself out there to meet people.",symp/reasoning,26_81,P,id,
"Okay. All right. So, that kind of pressure. Yeah. And then you said that you didn't really like Bruce, what kind of person was a man? What was making you not like him so well?",routine,26_82,T,irq,
"I mean, he's just kind of like a sketchy guy. Okay.",routine,26_83,P,id,
"Oh, so that maybe that there was something going on between Bruce and your mom prior to the divorce? Yeah. Sorry to hear that must have been really hard. Yeah. And were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time? Yeah. Okay. Like, were you? I mean, how what was the arrangement where you're spending time with him sometimes and spending time with your mom?",routine,26_84,T,irq,
Yeah. So I said my mom during the week and I got to my dad like every other week. Okay.,routine,26_85,P,id,
"Okay. So then, given the fact that in case you weren't happy in school, you said that it was more kind of an uppity school, private school. Kids Was it a mixed school or was it like an all girls school? Yeah, mix school and that kind of clicky sounds like and then your mom really sounds like she really was pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you so that you fit in a little bit better. So when in this process Did you find yourself like like turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge things like",story,26_86,T,irq,
"dieting, it's definitely I guess, like eighth grade, ninth grade. And that definitely came from like, my mom thinking were telling me that to look a certain way to knit Yeah, and then there were times like, like there was unhealthy food around the hospital debris seats. Mm hmm. And is there an accessible at times like I would eat that I would say for the most part, I would try to like really restrict myself to Okay.",story,26_87,P,id,
Okay. And do you recall the first time that you then vomited or use vomiting as a way to kind of like manage the overeating?,symp/reasoning,26_88,T,irq,
"I mean, just like pressures of starting High School, and I'm in a same school, same people and I really wasn't happy, hard to make friends. I don't know When I guess I heard from some of the other girls about, like vomiting as like an option, right, that they've heard some of their friends talk about before. Right? Right. Yeah, so, okay. And like the dieting even though if I was eating healthy, I would still hear from my mom like, oh, like you need to look like this, right? Here's this outfit I want you to wear, but you can't wear it like if your body's like that.",story,26_89,P,id,
"So she was really critical of how you looked. Okay, okay, so then what was that? What did that do? Let me take a step back. So it sounds like that. You've always been a little closer to your dad. So then what was the divorce and the move and some of that transition? What effect did that have on your relationship with your mom?",routine,26_90,T,crq,
"I mean, I don't even really remember like a really good time with my mom.",routine,26_91,P,cd,
Okay. Okay. All right. So the two of you don't get along as well. Okay. Did it was it getting? Was it kind of the same during that time? Or was it getting worse?,routine,26_92,T,irq,
"I mean, I guess I was getting more vocal towards her and speaking my mind more.",routine,26_93,P,id,
"Okay. All right. And then she was then coming back more harshly and more critically. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, it's not unusual. I mean, a couple things, certainly not unusual for, you know, girls at that age, you know, in terms of like, kind of the social influence or kind of the social contagion of, you know, with eating and diet, you know, binge eating and dieting and vomiting. So it sounds like that, that was kind of, in some respects part of that culture. But it also sounds like that there, you know, in terms of the external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look a particular way. It almost sounded like that, that she was saying that you were like, What? You were too heavy for a particular outfit. And so then, I'm sure that that Do you remember how that was feeling to you at that time when she would say things like that?",story,26_94,T,irq,
"Today? Yeah, I felt like nothing I could do. Right. Right. Yeah.",routine,26_95,P,id,
All right cut of Trump. Did you talk to anybody about that? Did you talk with your dad about that? Or?,routine,26_96,T,irq,
"It's like, No, not really. Okay. We have.",routine,26_97,P,id,
"Okay. So you kept a lot of those feelings to yourself. Okay. All right. Okay, well, that's that's, that's helpful. Let's kind of let's kind of hang on to that, because we've got a couple things because obviously, I think the the divorce the move the transition from middle school to high school. Also sounds though that also during that time that you're obviously you didn't have a very good relationship with Bruce to begin with. And that your relationship with your mom was kind of deteriorating. Yeah. And then I know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in, in high school, but during that time, like, you know, eighth or ninth grade, did you have more contact with her? Were you able to, like",story,26_98,T,irq,
