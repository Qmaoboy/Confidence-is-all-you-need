"My teachers all seem to think I'm doing well. They actually I see To get good feedback on my assignments, but I feel like I feel like I just to make sure I'm doing well. I really focus on like the details like making sure that the instructions are really clear, like I'm doing everything, like perfectly as an Instructure instructor wants because I'm really afraid that you know, if I'm not really clear on what the assignment is, then maybe I won't do it the right way.

"Well, I guess I'm just feeling that, you know, I've worked really hard, this whole program and I don't want to mess it up now or, you know, because if I don't get these grades, and I feel like what was the use, if I met, then I'm going to be ruining all this hard work, that I've done this whole program if I kind of, if I don't maintain that level of, you know, like you said, precision, I feel like like that I've let myself down or that I'm a failure because I'm, I just slacked off at the end of the program and it's so close to being done.",symp/reasoning,174_19,P,id,-1
So what grade would you have to receive for you to feel like you have failed,routine,174_20,T,irq,0
probably less than an A. Anything other than A,symp/reasoning,174_21,P,id,-1
right below an A isn't A minus?,routine,174_22,T,irq,0
"I mean, I guess I would be okay with that, but I wouldn't be really happy with it. ",symp/reasoning,174_23,P,id,-1

I wouldn't be that excited about that.,symp/reasoning,174_25,P,id,-1
a B?,routine,174_26,T,irq,0
I wouldn't be happy with that.,symp/reasoning,174_27,P,id,-1

But a B plus and a B?,routine,174_30,T,irq,0
"to me like, like an A minus I would maybe be okay with but like, below that like to me like a B, whether it's like a B minus A B, A, B plus it's all B, and that's not an",symp/reasoning,174_31,P,id,-1
so what would it mean to you if you received a B?,routine,174_32,T,irq,0
"that I didn't try hard enough, but there's something else I could have done to to do better that I was like, slacking or I didn't read the directions right or I didn't have enough responses or make my paper long enough. I just didn't do enough. ",symp/reasoning,174_33,P,id,-1
But you didn't try hard enough that you didn't do enough. What would it mean If that were true?,routine,174_34,T,irq,0
If I didn't try hard enough that I was lazy.,symp/reasoning,174_35,P,id,-1
That you were lazy?,routine,174_36,T,irq,0
"Yeah, that I could have tried harder and I didn't. So why didn't I try? I didn't, maybe I didn't care. I was lazy. Kind of like what's the use? If you're not gonna try your best and why try it all?",symp/reasoning,174_37,P,id,-1
"Okay, now we we've talked before about automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions right in other sessions and one of the cognitive distortions is this idea that unuseful type of thinking and Aaron thinking is when you think of everything in terms of like, Black or White, all or nothing? So sounds like you have a little tolerance for like an A minus you're not completely there. But generally, it's kind of an A of some type, right? Or you're not interested. Right. So we get down to you didn't try hard enough and if that were true, the new would be lazy. Right? Which, you know, having senior these last few sessions is clear to me. You're not lazy. But that's the body.",routine,174_38,T,gc,0
Yes.,inactive,174_39,P,ack,0
"Now, it seems that earlier in your earlier years in the program, this was the Acer effortless for you, but you'd have to work as hard for them. ",routine,174_40,T,gc,0
Yeah,inactive,174_41,P,ack,0
what's what do you think has changed?,routine,174_42,T,orq,0
"I'm not quite sure. Like it didn't stress me out as much in the beginning of the program. Like I really like school. But now I feel like I'm static because it's anxiety producing for me because, you know, I'm constantly worried",symp/reasoning,174_43,P,od,-1
"You mentioned part of it was you can get close to the end, right. So is there anything else?",routine,174_44,T,irq,0
"Well, the only thing I can think of is we have the same students throughout our program. But I guess this semester there's a new student in the program and I know that you mentioned and it seems like she's kind of really stressing me out. And also well see throughout the program, I kind of considered myself like to be the student who got the best grades and there's this award at the end of the program for doing really well. And I kind of made it a goal of mine to get this award at the end because I felt like that would show that I really tried hard this program really meant a lot to me. I think You know, it would show people who viewed Did that, you know, I really busted my butt and, and did a good job in this program. And for the whole program so far, you know, that was me like that was I was kind of the front runner, I guess for this award. And this semester, there's a new student and then come to find out like she had a 4.0 in her other program. So,",story,174_45,P,id,-1
"so if I'm reading you, right, you you really didn't have any competition for this award that you were aware of. Right? And now you feel like you really do,",routine,174_46,T,crq,0
"right like I feel like the pressures on like, I felt like I tried so hard, this whole program and now like this new person comes in, and she might want a different me so I really need to go above and beyond to make sure that I'm still on track.",symp/reasoning,174_47,P,cd,-1
"I'm paradoxically that's caused you to be more anxious and more stressed and your performing but you're still getting the A's which are working harder to get the A's,",routine,174_48,T,gc,0
right. And it's causing me a lot of anxiety with school where it's not as enjoyable for me as it once was.,symp/reasoning,174_49,P,ack,-1
"So what would it mean if you couldn't get the award if you didn't with the, what's the name of the new was first name with a new choice choice? Okay, but of choice once award, and you didn't want me?",routine,174_50,T,gc,0
"I guess part of me feels like them. Why did I do the program? if, you know, part of me feels like if you're not going to be the best why try? So if, if she got the award over me, then it's kind of like, why did I work so hard this whole time, like I could have been slacking this whole time and just skated by so why did I bust my butt? If it was all for nothing? I don't have anything to show for it. ",symp/reasoning,174_51,P,id,-1
So its all or nothing if you don't win the award.,routine,174_52,T,gc,0
"I mean, I guess it's not the only thing that matters so part of me feels that way sometimes that I have these thoughts that if I don't try my hardest and do well and win this award, then why do I try so hard the rest of the time, but like it negates all the positive things. This that this, you know, kind of like the end result like if you tried hard the whole race and then you lose, you know, at the end.",symp/reasoning,174_53,P,gc,-1
"Right, but you're not really losing a race because you would still graduate?",routine,174_54,T,gc,0
Yeah.,inactive,174_55,P,ack,0
"You're you're just not getting a word, which you would like, right and which would be great. Right, and certainly accomplishment. But the reason you came to the program was to get the degree,",routine,174_56,T,gc,0
"right and even know about the award until probably like the second year anyway, so that wasn't the reason I entered. But,",symp/reasoning,174_57,P,gc,0
but it's now it's now taken on some importance for you winning award has been a real goal.,routine,174_58,T,gc,0

"So with the new student choice coming in, I have this increased competition. ",routine,174_60,T,gc,0
Right.,inactive,174_61,P,ack,0
"And that's causing me anxiety is caused you to work hard for the same grade. All right. So, as we talked before, you have a tendency to be, I mean, this as a compliment a little perfectionistic. Right. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. It is taking too far, It can be right it can be not useful. Ever hear the phrase Perfect is the enemy of good. No. Does that make sense what that might mean? ",routine,174_62,T,gc,0
Yeah.,inactive,174_63,P,op,0
Yeah. So this desire to be perfect or to win the award is potentially causing you not even to perform well. Right?,routine,174_64,T,crq,0
Right,inactive,174_65,P,cd,-1
you're still getting the A's but it's called the anxiety and you're working hard and,routine,174_66,T,gc,0

"I mean, it kind of sounds silly when you when you're reflecting it back to me how, you know that I have to read the words like I, I think that it makes sense. You know, that wasn't my goal going into it. You know, why does it matter so much to me that there's different degrees of success. I think if you've said before that is Not all about the award, I think I would be happy with just, you know, getting the degree and all the stuff that I've learned. And I would feel like it was, if I didn't get the award rather, I would feel like it was still a worthwhile journey.

It's really hard.,symp/reasoning,174_87,P,gc,0
