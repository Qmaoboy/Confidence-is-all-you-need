"Okay, how are you?",inactive,106_0,P,gt,
Good. Thanks for asking. I understand you've come here today to the agency because you had a recent arrest.,symp/reasoning,106_1,T,gt,
"Yeah, I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol, marijuana,",symp/reasoning,106_2,P,id,
"alcohol and marijuana. How recently was this DUI? About a week ago? Okay, so what's been going on when that happened?",symp/reasoning,106_3,T,irq,
"Um, well, I am going to have to go to courtsoon. And I know that I'm probably gonna have to go I'd like treatment or something like that, but I really just don't want to. So I just, I'm just coming here becauseI don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm gettingsome type of treatment. But yeah,",symp/reasoning,106_4,P,id,
get out of it. You mean get out of the charge?,routine,106_5,T,crq,
"Yeah. I mean, I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to like rehab or something like that. And I don't want to do that.",routine,106_6,P,cd,
So you feel like you can get out of the rehab or two.,routine,106_7,T,orq,
I don't know. I really am not sure.,inactive,106_8,P,od,
"So at this recent arrest, you realize it may be a value to stop using which really don't want to Yeah, stuck there.",routine,106_9,T,yq,
Yeah kind of,inactive,106_10,P,op,
when you drink Do you ever socialize the same time?,routine,106_11,T,yq,
I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like at my house,routine,106_12,P,id,
alone so do the marijuana,routine,106_13,T,crq,
yeah I mean I like a few people that are like smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself and myself every day so it was with people,routine,106_14,P,cd,
so it doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using now early sweetie losing,symp/reasoning,106_15,T,id,
um this this alcohol and I want to take it for pain relief qualities Yeah. ,symp/reasoning,106_16,P,id,
Any other reasons um,routine,106_17,T,yq,
it's just easier,routine,106_18,P,id,
forget about problems Yeah. So affects your mood in a positive way.,symp/reasoning,106_19,T,id,
Yeah like I get like I like the feeling once I'm drunk,symp/reasoning,106_20,P,ack,
Have you use since you had to do it?,routine,106_21,T,yq,
"Um, I haven't drank but I've as a situation. ",routine,106_22,P,id,
So you have the use it takes away pain for you to take swings xiety feels good. But then you have these consequences of the law. And you figure those two things out.,routine,106_23,T,id,
I don't know. I don't know if there is what was your wealth of knowledge. So like not as just,routine,106_24,P,id,
You can imagine that. So it was a good the other side. Can you imagine having further it says law enforcement like more charges in the future.,routine,106_25,T,yq,
I guess I hadn't really considered that.,inactive,106_26,P,on,
So you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence. And you'll be more careful in the future.,routine,106_27,T,yq,
"I don't know. Yeah, I guess so.",inactive,106_28,P,on,
"So with that thinking, you continue to use as you were, that you would take out the part that got you in trouble.",routine,106_29,T,id,
Yeah.,inactive,106_30,P,ack,
First you have to get out of trouble this time.,routine,106_31,T,id,
Yep.,inactive,106_32,P,ack,
"So if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana, would you continue to use it?",routine,106_33,T,yq,
I just couldn't imagine,routine,106_34,P,id,
So there's a social component here.,routine,106_35,T,id,
"Yeah, a little bit. I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like nine five jobs. They don't drink every day. But I do. But like on the weekends, like all of my friends who I",routine,106_36,P,ack,
"So even if you had no anxiety, no pain You'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends. How would they respond if you went out with them? I didn't drink.",routine,106_37,T,irq,
"Um, they probably just like wouldn't understand it, because we all go out and we get like really drunk and",routine,106_38,P,id,
So it'd be socially awkward. straining the relationships with your friends. So the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you,routine,106_39,T,id,
know.,inactive,106_40,P,gc,
But then you have this distressing situation which is making you second guessed some of it.,routine,106_41,T,id,
"Yeah, I mean, it's making me think that like, maybe I, I need to, like make a change. I just can't see that. That's the change I'm making. So",routine,106_42,P,ack,
"you need to make some change. Yeah, but not the alcohol. Drugs.",routine,106_43,T,id,
"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,106_44,P,ack,
Something else could change.,inactive,106_45,T,id,
"Yeah, I don't know what but",inactive,106_46,P,on,
"So you could reduce your usage, avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal. Would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety of the pain?",routine,106_47,T,irq,
Am I just not going anywhere ever? I might not drive as often,routine,106_48,P,id,
"So that strategy might not work. That's something you've been tossing around though, this idea of isolating a little bit more, and drinking a little less. Seems like all your options here kind of grim. Yeah, that's just that's just me doesn't seem that way to you too.",routine,106_49,T,id,
Now that I'm like,inactive,106_50,P,id,
"talking through it, yeah.",inactive,106_51,T,gc,
I'd like don't think I have any choice really,routine,106_52,P,od,
have any choice? What's going to happen is going to happen?,routine,106_53,T,crq,
I don't know.,routine,106_54,P,on,
All right. So let's start with the lead now. Pick up with me now. You don't want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with a DUI. What do you think you could do that would make a bad impression?,routine,106_55,T,irq,
"Um, go to court drug",routine,106_56,P,id,
I would do it.,routine,106_57,T,id,
"Get another DUI in the meantime, that was not good either.",routine,106_58,P,id,
"So you want to avoid those behaviors for sure. So you know, for sure you don't want to have sex? Would it be acceptable those things anyway?",routine,106_59,T,irq,
"I mean, not really. I mean, I think I should avoid does not like drunk driving enough. Or maybe not during the day of my court date,",routine,106_60,P,id,
So would you appreciate those skulls like avoiding those situations I go in the court truck,routine,106_61,T,id,
Yeah.,inactive,106_62,P,ack,
Goals that you could get behind,routine,106_63,T,id,
"I mean, I can try I guess to like think about it and Charlie get out now I'm gonna be stressed out ate my court date. It's gonna be hard to like not drink that day.",routine,106_64,P,id,
You're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea.,routine,106_65,T,od,
Now,inactive,106_66,P,gc,
"this is really tough for you is the outcome. The marriage laws are important. Yeah, this whole this book, do you I think it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed. Yeah. So is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life with fat that is gonna change things",routine,106_67,T,id,
"I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it then just dealing with it. I mean, if I like don't go to court or anything that's like a worn out for me like I can't, I can't avoid this situation.",routine,106_68,P,id,
"But if there's a condition of your treatment, the judge says no more drinking is no more marijuana period. We can see that that if you obey those rules or word, jail",routine,106_69,T,id,
"now, I couldn't get to that. I know it possibly could probably well, but I was I don't know.",routine,106_70,P,id,
I would think it almost certainly would have happened. Yeah.,routine,106_71,T,id,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.,inactive,106_72,P,on,
back a couple of steps. How long have you been using the alcohol marijuana?,symp/reasoning,106_73,T,irq,
"For about like, six years, six years.",symp/reasoning,106_74,P,id,
"Have you ever until now with the DUI, have you ever envisioned stopping? Now, what's your plan? Like pre d? Why was your plan and all this?",routine,106_75,T,yq,
I just had dinner like the jerking kind of has gotten worse.,routine,106_76,P,id,
Yeah. So without this or something you would have continued using?,routine,106_77,T,yq,
"Yeah, I didn't really have any like",routine,106_78,P,id,
until now. Yeah. Could this be a strange way like an opportunity?,routine,106_79,T,yq,
"I mean, I guess if I had if I wanted to stop by this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop.",routine,106_80,P,id,
If you really wanted to stop because your stuff,routine,106_81,T,id,
I don't know.,routine,106_82,P,on,
you could give a shot. You're just not sure you could. You could actually do it.,routine,106_83,T,id,
"Yeah, I mean, I've never tried to before so I don't know.",routine,106_84,P,on,

summary,"The patient got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol and marijuana about a week ago. The patient is not losing any social support by stopping to drink since they do it alone. They do it for pain relief and feeling good. There is a little social component of drinking with friends during the weekends. The patient has been drinking and using marijuana for six years now. The patient hasn't really considered to stop using, but they feel they can if they intend to stop. The therapist offers to meet again since the court hearing is not for another few weeks. They promise to have IEP and other things in the second week and pick up with that.  ",,,,
