Carl How you doing today?,inactive,47_0,T,gt,
"Good, ",inactive,47_1,P,gt,
good how are you?,inactive,47_2,P,gt,
I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.,inactive,47_3,T,gt,
Last week you were talking in therapy?,inactive,47_4,T,irq,
"Yeah. I mean, I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week, but but Jill was telling you about Jill, a co worker. And, you know, she was kind of bothered me the past couple weeks, but really, this this past week was like the worst, right? So she's not doing her paperwork. And the thing is, is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports. So if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine. And then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do theirs and it's a mess. The whole thing's a mess. And it's just it's annoying.",symp/reasoning,47_5,P,id,
"So her work slow down, or not being efficient work is affecting your work productivity.",symp/reasoning,47_6,T,gc,
"Yeah. Yeah, it definitely is. And it it's one of those things that like,",routine,47_7,P,ack,
"you know, has, it gives me a bad",routine,47_8,P,id,
"a bad evaluation, you know, like, if I'm not in my stuff in in time, the number reflects negatively on me, you know, and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time. So she doesn't, then I don't then the next person and so forth, and it makes it seem",story,47_9,P,id,
"like you're not doing her job,",routine,47_10,P,id,
"right? Yeah. And my boss doesn't like it. my boss's boss doesn't like and so forth. You know, and I try to explain them. You know, she's the problem, but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like, here's what's happening or just somehow it doesn't Now,",story,47_11,P,id,
you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation.,routine,47_12,T,yq,
"Yeah. And that's pretty annoying too. Because,",routine,47_13,P,ack,
"you know, it's one thing if people get mad at me, but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job, like I'm supposed to. But it's another thing for them to get mad at me. Not realizing it's not my fault.",story,47_14,P,id,
"You know, you have an explanation for why that works.",routine,47_15,T,crq,
"Yeah, I do. I do. That's the thing. But I can't always get it out. You know, I can always tell the person that's has the complaint about and yeah, I mean, I've tried talking to my, my boss. And I've tried talking other people too, you know, but really hasn't gotten anywhere.",story,47_16,P,ack,
So you're feeling stuck with this whole thing?,routine,47_17,T,irq,
"Yeah. Yeah, I mean,",inactive,47_18,P,ack,
"I talked to Joe a little bit about it, too. You know, and I tried to ask, I tried to kind of gently reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock. I didn't want to be real abrasive, you know, but I, I tried to remind him as a polite approach. Yeah. Yeah. And it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening. You know,",story,47_19,P,id,
your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want.,routine,47_20,T,crq,
"It really hasn't. And, and that's just, I feel like I've tried everything that I could try.",routine,47_21,P,cd,
"You know, and even like, I came home and I",routine,47_22,P,cd,
"was talking to a friend about it, and",routine,47_23,P,cd,
"I was trying to think of other solutions, right. You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do what else I could say. Who else I could talk to things like that. You know, and my friend, you know, you He was listening and stuff. He had some good suggestions, but he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company works.",story,47_24,P,cd,
"So like, I got nothing. You're not getting the help you need for this.",routine,47_25,P,cd,
"Yeah, not at all feeling pretty lost with it. And I wish there was just like a",routine,47_26,P,cd,
clear way to do things like this is what you should do now. And I don't see anything some,routine,47_27,P,cd,
sort of clear plan.,routine,47_28,T,yq,
"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,47_29,P,ack,
"But yeah, I don't",inactive,47_30,P,on,
"I don't see a way to go about it. I mean I've so I've Okay, so this is the way I laid out in my mind. I tried talking to the people above me didn't work out the way I thought it would. I tried talking to the people below me so to speak, just lower on the before me in the process. That's what I mean. And that didn't work out which is just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work.",story,47_31,P,id,
"So like, there's nowhere else I could turn.",routine,47_32,P,id,
The options are exhausted.,routine,47_33,T,od,
"Yeah, that's what it seems like to me.",inactive,47_34,P,ack,
And this is frustrating for you.,symp/reasoning,47_35,T,gc,
"Yeah, it is. And I've been trying to wrack my brain. You know, like, what else could I do? You know, like, maybe if I could maybe if there was like, a committee or something that I could go to, you know, and be like, well, this person's not doing what they're supposed to be doing. But there's not a committee like that. Or even if there was like a person, you know, like, a resolution person or whatever, but there's nobody like that.",story,47_36,P,ack,
There's no other avenue. ,inactive,47_37,T,id,
"It sort of seems like to me Yeah. I mean, that's",inactive,47_38,P,ack,
"and you know, as I'm even trying to think like,",inactive,47_39,P,gc,
"I don't know, should I Write a letter to somebody maybe. But I don't even know who or what",routine,47_40,P,gc,
you thought about a letter.,routine,47_41,T,irq,
But who would you send it to?,routine,47_42,T,irq,
Yeah.,inactive,47_43,P,ack,
Or like just something else that I can I can do instead of going to this person though to that person that didn't work.,routine,47_44,P,id,
Can I can I,inactive,47_45,P,id,
"call somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that? But I mean, there's there's HR people, but",routine,47_46,P,id,
I can't really see where they could come in. I don't know how human resources could deal with something like that.,routine,47_47,P,id,
You don't view them as a potential solution.,routine,47_48,T,crq,
"No, I don't.",inactive,47_49,P,on,
Wondering if there's like a,routine,47_50,P,cd,
"But there's I mean, I'm thinking now that there's gotta be something or somebody, or somewhere that I could put in, like, almost like a complaint or something like, something's out of my hands. And I don't know what to do about it, but there's got to be something. And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's got to be",story,47_51,P,cd,
some other resource you haven't tried yet.,routine,47_52,T,irq,
"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,47_53,P,ack,
"I mean, now I'm trying to think back to my training, you know, initially",routine,47_54,P,id,
"you know, maybe there's, you know what, I think now that I'm, now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about a little bit differently about it. I'm thinking that there's like, man, I forget what they call it now, but maybe like a complaint but It's not the right word, but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something. And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting, which we have, like every other week.",story,47_55,P,id,
They're discussed at this regular meeting.,routine,47_56,T,gc,
"Yeah. And I'm thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it. But I'm thinking like, maybe that's an avenue that I can use, you know, like, maybe that'll get brought up. And maybe that's something that that might actually work. ",story,47_57,P,gc,
This could be another option for you.,routine,47_58,T,orq,
"Yeah, it could be. And then if it does work, it'll get brought rather if they do read it, it'll get brought up at the staff meeting. where everybody's at my boss, my boss's boss, Jill, everybody's there. And maybe that's a way for it to come to most attention. That deadlines being missed, affect other people in ways that you don't really know about.",story,47_59,P,od,
So everyone will hear your complaint,routine,47_60,T,gc,
and maybe react in a way to help you maybe.,routine,47_61,T,gc,
"Yeah, I think that's, I mean, that's gotta be the way to do it. And maybe that's the best way. I really think. Yeah, I mean, after saying all that, and after going through that, I really think that that's probably the best way to do it. And if it doesn't, then I guess I can find another way. But I really think that's the best way to do it.",story,47_62,P,gc,
You feel as though you found an option here?,routine,47_63,T,irq,
"Yeah. Yeah. And even if that doesn't work, then it'll be brought up. And maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it. And maybe I'll understand really where I'm coming from. But this will at least be a start to something you know, to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff in",symp/reasoning,47_64,P,id,
your first Started with all this.,routine,47_65,T,crq,
"Yeah. But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion.",symp/reasoning,47_66,P,cd,
Maybe I won't be as frustrated.,routine,47_67,P,cd,
"I mean, I'm feeling a little less frustrated now. Even thinking if there is another option.",routine,47_68,P,cd,
It feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here.,routine,47_69,T,gc,
"Yeah. Yeah, that's,",inactive,47_70,P,ack,
"well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up.",inactive,47_71,T,gt,
That feels like the right.,inactive,47_72,P,gt,
Move for you. Yeah. And we'll schedule See you next week. And we can pick up from there. Sounds good. All right. Cool. Next car. Thank you.,routine,47_73,T,gt,
summary,"The patient has an issue with their co worker who has not been doing their paperwork for the past couple of weeks. This annoys the patient and affects their efficiency in work productivity. The co worker is first in line and it affects everyone's work which their boss doesn't like. The patient doesn't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at their work about the situation and that is annoying too since people get mad at the patient. The patient feels stuck. They have tried to talk to the co worker Joe, but it didn't seem to work. The patient feels they are not able to find a clear plan and have exhausted all options. The patient does not know whom to complain to at the company since there is no committee and feels HR might not be of help too. The patient thinks of a complaint box with which they could pass on the complaint. They feel even if it is not resolved, it will brought up in a meeting and they will be able to discuss with their boss and a feel a lot less stressed. The patient feels better just thinking of another option. The therapist schedules following session next week. ",,,,
