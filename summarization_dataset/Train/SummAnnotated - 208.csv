"Right. What was it that happened Jane to bring, bring that relationship to an end?",symp/reasoning,208_12,T,irq,
"Well, like I said, because it was going so well, you know, I asked I asked him to move in, right. And he said that he didn't want to. And we ended up arguing and getting into big fights And then he said he was going and you know, I begged him not to, but you know, he still went anyway.",symp/reasoning,208_13,P,id,
So was it after he had gone that you cut?,symp/reasoning,208_14,T,yq,

Right. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened when you cut?,symp/reasoning,208_16,T,irq,
"Well  he's gone, I just felt so I just couldn't bear the pain anymore. ",symp/reasoning,208_17,P,id,
Right,inactive,208_18,T,ack,
"And my voices which is incessant, And I just you know just want to get rid of all the pain all the voices and so you know just, you know just cut myself.",symp/reasoning,208_19,P,id,
And did that help with the pain and the voices?,symp/reasoning,208_20,T,irq,
"Yeah, yeah, just yeah, I mean you took the pain away and tonight was just something about seeing blood really its fine. I just made it feel better.",symp/reasoning,208_21,P,id,
"So, with the cutting is this something that you've, you've done before",routine,208_22,T,crq,
I am doing this since I Was teenager.,symp/reasoning,208_23,P,cd,
Right. Okay. And it sounds like there are times when you do it when it it helps.,routine,208_24,T,crq,
Yeah.,inactive,208_25,P,ack,
Right,inactive,208_26,T,ack,
and takes the pain off.,symp/reasoning,208_27,P,cd,
Right. And are there any downsides to the cutting?,symp/reasoning,208_28,T,yq,
"Well, yeah, I mean, it's been painful  I suppose the main things. My arms and legs are a mess. ",symp/reasoning,208_29,P,ack,
"Right. Okay. Okay. And you mentioned Jain voices, And I know you've spoken to doctors about them before. ",routine,208_30,T,crq,
Yeah,inactive,208_31,P,ack,
"but can I just ask you a few more questions about and please, if that's okay. Okay, can you tell me? How long is it that you've been hearing the voices?",symp/reasoning,208_32,T,irq,
That since I was a teenager as well.,symp/reasoning,208_33,P,id,
"And do you know other is, how many voices are there or who they are?",symp/reasoning,208_34,T,irq,
I don't know who they are. It's mainly my stepdad.,symp/reasoning,208_35,P,id,
Right.,inactive,208_36,T,ack,
He just tells me how dirty I am and right. How horrible I am.I don't know sometimes it's my mom as well.,routine,208_37,P,id,
What kind of things Does your mom say?,routine,208_38,T,irq,
I think maybe she says about things in my life.,routine,208_39,P,id,
Right. Okay. And how often is it that you get these voices,symp/reasoning,208_40,T,irq,
"out there all the time Yeah, generally the sort of sitting there butAnd then you sometimes the louder than others and it's like the other night, the mice will have been in the room. ",symp/reasoning,208_41,P,id,
Right. Did you think they were in the room?,symp/reasoning,208_42,T,irq,
"No, I mean, I know that they're not there But it's like they're just so loud in my head.",symp/reasoning,208_43,P,id,
So can I just clarify that other voices seem as though they're inside your head? Or was it like my voice coming through your ears?,routine,208_44,T,irq,
"No. So inside inside your head, yeah",symp/reasoning,208_45,P,id,
okay. Okay. Okay. And am I right in thinking that they they trouble you more at times when you get stressed out?,symp/reasoning,208_46,T,yq,
"Yeah, right. ",symp/reasoning,208_47,P,ack,
"Okay. Okay. Can I ask you a few more general questions about how you are in your mood? How, how would you say that you, you feel generally kind of in yourself.",routine,208_48,T,irq,
"Most of the time, it's not just like being me.",routine,208_49,P,id,
Sounds as it can be very difficult sometimes. It sounds like you've used cutting in the past to help are there any of the things that you do to help when you feel really bad.,routine,208_50,T,gc,
"Drinking, smoke few spliffs now and then so much now, in the past I don't know, I just had a funny thing about food, you know it's all i binge and then just throw it back up again. ",symp/reasoning,208_51,P,gc,
"Okay, and that was in the past, but but not recently.",symp/reasoning,208_52,T,crq,
I haven't done it recently.,symp/reasoning,208_53,P,cd,
"And can I ask Jane, it sounds like when you cook the other night, you were doing it, sort of to kind of get rid of the pain. Can I just clarify where you're doing it to try and kill yourself.",routine,208_54,T,yq,
No.,routine,208_55,P,on,
Okay. Have there ever been times in the past when you have tried to kill yourself?,symp/reasoning,208_56,T,orq,
"late teens, then around when it was 19 I don't know. It just got to a point where I didn't want to be anymore. So I took some tablets",symp/reasoning,208_57,P,id,
So that was in your late teens and at the time you took the tablets because you wanted to be dead. Is that right?,symp/reasoning,208_58,T,crq,
Yeah,inactive,208_59,P,ack,
"Okay. Okay, but you've not wanted to be dead since that time in your late teens? ",routine,208_60,T,yq,
No.,routine,208_61,P,on,
Okay. Can I ask a few more general questions about your home situation? Who is it Is it is there anyone at home with you?,symp/reasoning,208_62,T,irq,
"Well my daughter used to live with me, okay But right now she is gone to live with her dad now",symp/reasoning,208_63,P,id,
Right? So she's gone to live with her dad that quite recently,routine,208_64,T,irq,
a year ago,routine,208_65,P,id,
and what was what was that about?,routine,208_66,T,irq,
she just couldn't cope with the fact that I was cutting myself might run into friends. She knew it was happening. And I suppose I suppose one of the big things as well as relationships I have,symp/reasoning,208_67,P,id,
the relationships you had?,routine,208_68,T,yq,
Hmm,routine,208_69,P,ack,
Can you tell me a bit more about that?,symp/reasoning,208_70,T,irq,
"Like the one we just had with Mark, you know, starts off being great. And then I got, I got really scared, really scared that they're gonna leave and then turns into a fights and they end up leaving anyway. ",symp/reasoning,208_71,P,id,
Right. And it sounds like your daughter struggled with that.,symp/reasoning,208_72,T,crq,
"Yeah, I mean, I suppose she didn't whether she was coming out going really",symp/reasoning,208_73,P,cd,
"Okay. Well, there are lots of relationships like that. ",inactive,208_74,T,gc,
Yeah.,inactive,208_75,P,ack,
Okay. You've seen Jane a few people in the past you've seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors. As anything that anyone's done for you before been particularly helpful.,symp/reasoning,208_76,T,gc,
I've been crap was Philip being passed from pillar to post.,routine,208_77,P,gc,
So you've not found anything that people have done particularly helpful in helping you to manage your relationships and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you.,symp/reasoning,208_78,T,crq,
"Its llike nobody's listening to me, You know, I think you're the only person who's actually sat and listened to what I've got to say,",symp/reasoning,208_79,P,cd,
"what do you think it would be worse? Given that this this has been such a long standing problem clearly does get gets in the way, quite a lot of aspects of your life. Do you think it would be worth us? meeting again one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this?",routine,208_80,T,orq,
"What do you mean one more time? Can I see you, you know, properly. ",routine,208_81,P,crq,
"Well, the way that we work here in this department is that we we see people once or twice and try and think with them about the best place for them to be and then refer them on to the most appropriate parts of the service. So it wouldn't be usual for me to see. See you more than once or twice Strain",routine,208_82,T,cd,
"Yeah like I said, You're the only person that's listened to me.",,208_83,P,od,
I know it's very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you're not going to continue to see me but it is the way that we work here is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs Jane. So would it be okay for me to book you in to come back and see me say next week for a second appointment and we can perhaps have a think of where to go from there.,routine,208_84,T,gc,
That'd be okay.,inactive,208_85,P,gc,
