Today,inactive,64_0,T,gc,
I've been working still on the fear of leaving the home for extended periods of time like vacation. And it's been a little harder recently because I have this plan trip with a friend of mine coming up in a few months and that's kind of been weighing on my mind.,symp/reasoning,64_1,P,gc,
Whereas the trip to?,symp/reasoning,64_2,T,irq,
Georgia,symp/reasoning,64_3,P,id,
how long way,symp/reasoning,64_4,T,irq,
"she wants to go like six days Yeah, I'm not sure with work and school and everything I can make the full six days and plus I'm a little nervous to go that long.",symp/reasoning,64_5,P,id,
So that's a long time for you.,symp/reasoning,64_6,T,gc,
It is yes.,symp/reasoning,64_7,P,gc,
So when did you discover this trip was going to be,symp/reasoning,64_8,T,irq,
"actually last Just a few days ago, she messaged me and said, Hey, you want to go with me and we'll go golfing and swimming. I love golfing. Like, I know I want to go. But I just had these just a little nervous about leaving",story,64_9,P,id,
"a little nervous? So when she made that call, ",symp/reasoning,64_10,T,irq,
"I was just a couple days ago, was the first thought he had kind of I can't go that long. That was my first thought. That's, that's too long. But he was like, wow, this would be great. I want to go down there golfing so bad and get away from the cold weather. So I mean, my immediate thought was no, not that long. But yes, I'm gonna go.",story,64_11,P,id,
"Alright, so so to kind of conflicting thoughts, right. So one, one is like, never go that long, six days, way too long. And the other one is that would be enjoyable. You enjoy that? ",symp/reasoning,64_12,T,irq,
Absolutely.,symp/reasoning,64_13,P,ack,
Yeah. So which way you're leaning right now.,symp/reasoning,64_14,T,irq,
I want to go to go for six days. Maybe just like a long weekend,symp/reasoning,64_15,P,id,
"3, 4 days?",symp/reasoning,64_16,T,irq,
two would be ideal but the idea of it two three days Yeah.,symp/reasoning,64_17,P,id,
So what we think is causing this worry about being gone more than two days?,symp/reasoning,64_18,T,irq,
"I don't know. I mean, I've always as a late teenager in my 20s I've always had just nervous to leave home I don't as much as I love being home I love to travel to and you know, do different things. It's just, I guess I'm just afraid something to happen when I'm not around.",story,64_19,P,id,
"Not to you're afraid something will happen to your, your house or,",story,64_20,T,crq,
"well, I have pets so we're about them. My parents are getting older, so I worry about them. Mainly, like my immediate family, mainly, I guess my dad, because he's had a history of heart attacks and then my pets that's such as for something to happen, I will be there.",story,64_21,P,cd,
"And how about when you were younger? You said this Problems found for was the same thing, the same thing. So mostly family and now some pets,",story,64_22,T,irq,
my pets then to see if that's,story,64_23,P,id,
"yes, your feelings are there fighting one another. Absolutely. And right now the feeling the thought anyway, have you know I would like to go on the trip. is winning But the fear thought was kind of dragging, dragging you down. Yeah. So what's the sensation of anxiety here?",story,64_24,T,irq,
"Yeah, I get anxious. Yeah, my heart gets feels like it's heavy my chest feels heavy and I just all these thoughts go through my mind like, you know, I know my parents um I can watch my pets but they may not take care of them like I would I don't know it's just I mean that you know they've always will take care of all my no but they'll miss me and they might tear my house up I don't all these thoughts in my mind that seem crazy to me.",story,64_25,P,id,
"So it seems like an endless stream of worries. Yeah. Surrounding family and pets. And what might happen. So really, that's that's it, right? This is what might happen. It's the uncertainty, right? So is anything ever happened?",story,64_26,T,irq,
"No, no",story,64_27,P,on,
Okay. So so far all worrying. And anxiety really hasn't paid me dividends.,symp/reasoning,64_28,T,irq,
"Yes. And now that I'm older when I was younger, I probably wouldn't like it overnight. But now that I'm older yes, I do I just say, I got to live my life and they'll be okay. I just try to tell myself they're in good hands. If something happens somebody Oh, call me but then I feel like oh, but I want to be hours away. I'm a plane ride away. And then I get thinking about that, but I do go. ",story,64_29,P,id,
But you didn't in the past,routine,64_30,T,crq,
no,routine,64_31,P,on,
So something changed. What changed?,routine,64_32,T,irq,
I don't know.I really,routine,64_33,P,on,
"right? So not sure what change but used to not go, now you do go. So when you're down there, or wherever you go in the trip, you're feeling better, like you're enjoying yourself. But you're also worried at the same time.",story,64_34,T,irq,
"Not too well. Once I get there, I'm usually okay. Maybe the first night I get a little worried. And then maybe when I'm getting ready to come home, I'm like a little anxious, I'm ready to get home to make sure everything's okay.",story,64_35,P,id,
And the rest of the time.,routine,64_36,T,irq,
"I'm usually Okay. I'll get some alcohol involved. So he kind of limits my anxiety. But once I get into like playing the golf and all that, I really do allow myself to enjoy it. It's just it seems like it's going and coming. That's",story,64_37,P,id,
"alright, so the problem really isn't when you're there. The problem is now leading up to it and maybe just the first half day, your day when you're there, and maybe the last half day or two there.",symp/reasoning,64_38,T,gc,
"It's like a plane. Like I don't have a problem, right, like flying out. But it's the thinking like, while I'm waiting for the plane like, Whoa, what if we What if a terrorist is on there? What if we crash? I'll think about all that before, but once I'm there and on the plane is right, take off. I'm fine. I'm completely fine. not anxious. It's leading up to the actual event that makes me anxious.",story,64_39,P,id,
"I suppose anticipation. So that's that's the worst part. All right, so the period between now when you leave, it's gonna be the worst part. ",symp/reasoning,64_40,T,od,
"Yes, ",symp/reasoning,64_41,P,ack,
but she'll probably stock up.,routine,64_42,T,gc,
Probably. But I'll have changed my mind probably a dozen times before actually say yes.,routine,64_43,P,gc,
And when you do go on Twitter.,routine,64_44,T,irq,
Yeah.,routine,64_45,P,ack,
something could happen. Certainly sure. But it Hasn't so far,routine,64_46,T,irq,
I don't know. I try not to think that for,routine,64_47,P,on,
"alright, so you'll, you'll return?",routine,64_48,T,yq,
Yeah. Still doesn't stop me from worrying when I get these trips planned.,routine,64_49,P,id,
"Yeah, so the probabilities of it really doesn't. That doesn't alleviate the Worry, worry still there. Right. Even though you know the worry is probably going to transition to enjoyment and looking forward to that that doesn't ",story,64_50,T,irq,
No not at all,story,64_51,P,on,
that doesn't leave anything at all.,routine,64_52,T,irq,
like I gotta get my house cleaned up and make sure my animals or everyday have enough food and I preparing to leave.,story,64_53,P,id,
"Preparing is productive, right? Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Well, how would the thoughts see you feel more connected to the warring?",routine,64_54,T,irq,
"Probably like, like, I want to, I want to say, I don't know I really it's kind of a word. Like I want to, like I can't say bye Not to my parents or I can't, you know, say bye enough to my pets like I feel like I like I don't I don't know, I don't really care. That's, I guess part of the problem. I don't know what I'm connecting it to.",story,64_55,P,id,
So if you don't tell them goodbye enough time.,routine,64_56,T,gc,
"Yeah, I don't know, maybe I sound so.",routine,64_57,P,ack,
"Oh, it sounds like maybe if you don't say if you don't say goodbye enough times and settled that, that you'll feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it ",story,64_58,T,od,
maybe.,routine,64_59,P,ack,
so that so that's the focal point of this thing's night in some way. Right?,routine,64_60,T,yq,
Let me go for a few days.,routine,64_61,P,gc,
And the way you start to let go is when you tell them,routine,64_62,T,crq,
Yeah.,routine,64_63,P,ack,
So So what do you find yourself doing? You say goodbye and then then leave and then come back? Or,routine,64_64,T,irq,
"do I just finally say, bye? I'll talk to you later love you. You know, I'll check in when I land or whatever and then that's it. Then it's like, I just have to try to breathe and just put those thoughts behind me. Because once I say it, it's like, Okay, that's it. I'm gone.",story,64_65,P,id,
"But you're but your thoughts are still coming thoughts are still come in and say, You should have said, goodbye one more time.",story,64_66,T,gc,
No. I just know that doesn't come to my mind,routine,64_67,P,gc,
that you didn't say goodbye well enough.,routine,64_68,T,gc,
I don't know.,routine,64_69,P,gc,
The property was the property of saying goodbye. This you feel like you're not doing well enough.,routine,64_70,T,gc,
"Maybe it's just the fact that I'm leaving. I shouldn't leave. say that, you know, maybe I feel like I maybe it's just the guilt of leaving.",story,64_71,P,gc,
So the act of leaving itself Leave shoot guilty. And what are you guilty of?,routine,64_72,T,irq,
Not being there if something happens.,routine,64_73,P,id,
So abandon,routine,64_74,T,gc,
maybe,routine,64_75,P,gc,
for a short time neglecting them for a short time.,routine,64_76,T,gc,
Probably maybe I did feel a little guilty.,routine,64_77,P,gc,
And now you're in more of a caregiver role than you were then.,routine,64_78,T,od,
"Maybe a little bit I mean, I've always been. I'm the youngest of mine, me and my sister, but my parents have always looked up to me to be the responsible one and make sure everything's taken care of so I probably kind of loud myself. To take on that role of the caregiver moreso or be at the more responsible one of the two.",story,64_79,P,id,
"So to be the responsible one, there needs to be guilt when you leave, I guess",routine,64_80,T,crq,
"maybe I should stay home and be responsible person and they don't make me feel guilty. They say go have a good time. Your baby's ugly. Okay, we'll take care of what I mean. I know they're in good hands. That's that's what's makes it so difficult. I know they'll be okay. But I just feel like a probably shouldn't go.",story,64_81,P,cd,
So there's not another person driving the skill towards you. That's me. Just coming in from the side.,routine,64_82,T,yq,
Yeah.,inactive,64_83,P,ack,
"So if I, if I leave, well, I'm responsible. And if I leave, something bad will happen. And that'll be on me.",routine,64_84,T,crq,
"Now when they're to fix it, or take care of it or make it better, like I put it on somebody else that have to do with that. Yeah.",routine,64_85,P,cd,
So fear of being caught as irresponsible.,routine,64_86,T,crq,
Maybe Yeah.,inactive,64_87,P,cd,
"And you could be a few left to just take you a day's travel or whatever, however far away. ",routine,64_88,T,crq,
Yeah.,inactive,64_89,P,cd,
"Right. So yeah, but that's that's still doesn't help relieve anxiety now when you come back, because ",routine,64_90,T,irq,
"no, not really. Because it's like, I want immediate access. Like, I want to be able to be right there within minutes if they need me.",story,64_91,P,id,
Have you ever taken a trip that was like within,routine,64_92,T,irq,
"I mean, not it's not as bad but yeah, there's back there. Stay with us. For an overnight there's some of the way up sometimes I'm thinking I should just stay home. Or I could be right in the same town sometimes that if I'm, I wake up at five in the morning, I just get up and go home because I just get really start feeling really anxious and I want to be home.",story,64_93,P,id,
"So the closer you are, it helps a little bit, it sounds like a good part of the anxiety is still there. So it really doesn't matter where you go. It's the fact that you're not home. The fact that you're not able to fully be responsible in the way that you view it.",story,64_94,T,od,
When I work 12 hour shifts and I have to work the overnight I will most of the time Take my break and go there between the chuck on Pima Benson.,story,64_95,P,gc,
So at 20 that's a long shift. So a 20 hour shift. At what point do you become anxious when did when you start to notice those thoughts?,story,64_96,T,irq,
"Probably usually like six, seven hours into it just depends like now it's getting dark so when it kind of gets dark and If I don't leave the light on or something, I get a little anxious. I feel like I need to go home and leave the light on and, you know, just let my pets know I'm coming back kind of weird, but I know they miss me. And then but if I'm busy, then I don't really think about it. So if you know if I'm busy at work, doing something I don't really think about until I stop what I'm doing right, slow down and I'm thinking, wow, I got 10 more hours or eight more hours. Sometimes I go home, sometimes they don't. Sometimes it's worse than others.",story,64_97,P,id,
"Right So if you're busy at work, the same reality exists, meaning your pets are alone. But the way you're responding to it is different. Yeah, you're less anxious.",story,64_98,T,gc,
Maybe because I know I'm close. I can get there. I know I'm in control. We'll be able to go there.,story,64_99,P,gc,
"Well, I'm buddy let's say not at work, let's say when you're on the vacations in those days in the middle when you're enjoying yourself. Is that a distraction like the more you enjoy yourself the last year",story,64_100,T,gc,
yeah.,inactive,64_101,P,ack,
"But the same reality exists there alone. So really, it's your way ofwhich way of viewing things that's leading to anxiety. It's not necessarily what's actually happening.",story,64_102,T,gc,
"It's my perception,",routine,64_103,P,gc,
"your perception of what's happening. What could happen. I guess in this case, not so much what is happening is what you worried. could could ",routine,64_104,T,gc,
"definitely, ",inactive,64_105,P,ack,
because nothing's happened yet.,routine,64_106,T,gc,
"No, not yet.",inactive,64_107,P,on,
"So, how many? Well, there's I guess there's a few different. There's a few different issues here. Right? How many vacations you take a year.",routine,64_108,T,irq,
"I don't really take long vacations I've taken only I've only taken like two week long vacations ever. For like, five, six days, and I was fine. Well, same anxiety when I was younger. And now it's more like long weekends or you know a night here or there I don't really take long vacations but probably maybe three or four times a year I'm like go away overnight versus just not just a friend's house like an actual vacation where I go into the city or something",story,64_109,P,id,
sort of small proportion of the time so just looking in terms of probabilities you risk is very low because you're not quite that much. But the other issue is that even at work you're still having the same feelings and even for short trips you're still have the same feelings. So you're really limiting things xietymuch of the time,story,64_110,T,irq,
"Yeah, '",inactive,64_111,P,ack,
it's been this way for years,symp/reasoning,64_112,T,irq,
"probably since a teenager and he hasn't stopped me I've always where every now I work more than ever I'm the more it doesn't stop me from working the kind of overtime working three jobs doesn't stop me and but I mean, like I said in as a teenager early 20s it did I would just be like, on my way out somewhere to go stay the night my boyfriend was like, Nope, I can't do it not to come home. But now that doesn't happen. And may not I may not go for a week long vacation, but I'll go for a few nights.",story,64_113,P,id,
So you're functioning?,routine,64_114,T,irq,
"Oh, yeah. '",routine,64_115,P,ack,
"Approved. Yeah, he's actually pretty good. working a lot sounds like",routine,64_116,T,crq,
Yeah.,inactive,64_117,P,ack,
Because this uncomfortable anxiety. This is painful for you.,routine,64_118,T,crq,
"Yeah, I mean, it doesn't like so it doesn't really seem to stop me from working obviously, because I work it's just the leading up to leaving for work or",routine,64_119,P,cd,
"going on vacation. Alright, so let's say",routine,64_120,T,orq,
"Well think about making sure I have everything I need for work, you know, don't have, I usually take my dinner.",routine,64_121,P,od,
"Do you feel less anxious when you With those prevention, okay, so that helps. Right? So physically preparing your house so that your pets are safer that helps you. So what else is going through your mind so you do that right you take all the precautions you can to keep them safe and prepare your dinner for work and everything. So what's the next thought?",story,64_122,T,irq,
"Just gotta go to work. I just think about I'll come home later. You know if I get a break. I mean usually I do especially if I do the overnight as I got downtime, so run home and check on and then I'm off to work and then I kind of forget about it. And then I said some lights is burned out not every night I come home and check off but some nights I just get started feel anxious and get thinking about them and I go on the trip.",story,64_123,P,id,
"So every time when you felt anxious and you wanted to check on them, but you couldn't leave ",story,64_124,T,orq,
"for now from out working with clients. Yeah, so what",story,64_125,P,od,
happens then terms of thinking and feeling?,story,64_126,T,irq,
"I don't dwell on it because my focus is with the client. So it just kind of think about it, I need to get home but you know, and I just focus back on the client, I don't let it overwhelm me or",story,64_127,P,id,
"Well, just so it doesn't change your function, but society has their anxiety associated with",story,64_128,T,od,
"it goes away. I mean, I want what I'm thinking about, but then it goes away.",story,64_129,P,od,
"Alright, so depending on what you're thinking about, that can change the level of anxiety you're experiencing.",story,64_130,T,od,
there's something or Yeah.,story,64_131,P,gc,
"Okay, so there's that is the that is the thought you're having something like that",story,64_132,T,crq,
"about older cats. I mean, he's really old something cool. You know what if, you know he's, something's happened to hell I mean, I don't honestly thinking I'm dying, but I think you know what he needs because he has he's really old. So I do think about him.",story,64_133,P,cd,
"I still have that you have that thought like,",story,64_134,T,crq,
Yes.,inactive,64_135,P,ack,
"So you can see the power of thinking and all this right. So the reality of your cat's health and well being hasn't changed the way you view it, as change the way you think about it. So we talked about before this idea of the adaptive response, right? So the thoughts you're having now that lead to the anxiety, we believe could lead to anxiety. They're automatic, right? They're just popping in your head. Right? It's triggered by certain things, like getting ready to leave for work and, and being at work while and look at the time and realizing something. We have the cats, right. But that's an automatic that just comes without, like, you can't necessarily stop right?",story,64_136,T,irq,
just comes naturally when I'm getting ready to leave.,routine,64_137,P,id,
"Then the anxiety is right there. So the adaptive response, we also call self talk. That's, that's a thought that you can give that you can create consciously. Right? You can think to yourself, so it's not automatic. It's not an adjustment of an automatic thought. It's a thought that you can deliberately think Almost like repeating a sentence that you've memorized, you can at will choose to do that. That makes sense. So I want to make sure I draw the distinction. Some thoughts just pop in. Other thoughts you deliberately, like, when we found is if you have a thought that you deliberately think we call the adaptive response. It can counter the feelings caused by the automatic thoughts, essentially. ",story,64_138,T,irq,
"You're challenging, you're disputing that automatic thought, this be my own thoughts.",routine,64_139,P,id,
"You're just spinning your thoughts. Yeah. So, you know, and I want you to work with me to develop these adaptive responses. I want you to have most of the site all the sites you want and because I think that you can develop ones that are useful to you, but just to give an example when you haven't thought that You know, the older cat can be sick, right? And adaptive response could be or could be wide, wide variety of thoughts, but one could be it's not likely. Right? Like, you know, or if it is likely that you know, he'll probably be okay. If it's a he or she, okay? He'll probably be okay till I get home. Another adaptive response could be it would be sad and unfortunate something happened. But I have my work responsibilities and at some point I have to leave the cats alone.",story,64_140,T,irq,
"I do tell them that I tell them thank them and I feel like them that well does someone want sometimes I run from me when I try to kiss them goodbye. And I'm like, Oh, no, what I have to go to work because you will have to eat. I know it sounds silly, but I do tell him that and then I kind of thinks it does. Most things. I think I didn't realize that's kind of what I was. But I do do that sometimes.",story,64_141,P,id,
So you're actively responding.,inactive,64_142,T,crq,
"Yeah, but I didn't realize that's what I was doing. But yeah, I do say that to myself to them. Yeah.",routine,64_143,P,cd,
"Well, I think that's a productive, adaptive response. I mean, you know, you're right. If you don't, if you don't earn income, then they'll have worse problems. ",routine,64_144,T,irq,
"Yeah, I can't take care of them being left alone. ",routine,64_145,P,id,
"So really good working. You're, you're being more of service to them and protecting them more so",routine,64_146,T,irq,
"Yeah, that's true. I never thought of it that way.",inactive,64_147,P,ack,
"So that might be one adaptive response you may want to consider applying when you have this, this feeling of anxiety",routine,64_148,T,orq,
"and then there's times I think, you know, they're just cats are probably the last to go on.",routine,64_149,P,od,
So they're not striking you as anxious when you get home.,routine,64_150,T,crq,
"Yeah. Well, sometimes sometimes sometimes after a 12 hour shift, yes, I have one of them. She won't show me let me sleep the first hour, she literally were around again and stuff. And I take it and she's mad because I've been gone, but she's fine.",story,64_151,P,cd,
"She continues to survive, despite being perhaps upset with you for leaving. So that could be another adaptive response that they may be enduring a mild stressor. But sometimes they're asleep when you get home. So ",story,64_152,T,gc,
"yeah, that's true.",routine,64_153,P,ack,
how bad could it be for them?,routine,64_154,T,irq,
"Yeah. And they don't know. I'm worrying or anxious. They could care less like they don't believe no, it's not bothering them. I mean,",routine,64_155,P,id,
"yeah, I mean, their level awareness clearly different than than yours. Right. So yeah, I mean, that's another good adaptive response that, you know, much higher level awareness, whereas you're not sure that Have any awareness that you're experiencing anxiety? Or maybe a little bit with a one cat who runs or think they do? ",story,64_156,T,irq,
"And that's just an animal person but I think they do but yeah, I probably give them think they have more feelings than what they probably really do. But they're my kids I treat them as kids my kids are all gods are important too. Yeah,",story,64_157,P,id,
absolutely. So it's understandable that you would be anxious and have concerns and but it also seems like you did make preparations to elevate their chances of having a successful experience right being okay.,routine,64_158,T,ack,
Yeah.,routine,64_159,P,ack,
"So you implement behaviors that are practical and that I've worked in making the house safe and keeping the plants away from them and so I think one route here if you're okay with it would be to use work as like the first point I know you have the trip. I know that's, that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst But you have more chances? Well, one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because it's more or less a daily thing, right? five days a week, or whatever it is. So some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together, right? You could apply those. And you know, think about that the responses are not always short. Right? The automatic thoughts could be short. It can even be images, do not necessarily even complete sentences, right? Like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation. So it's not necessarily spelled out in English, like a sentence, but adaptive responses. Well, they could be images too, but the ones I'm talking about are really sentences that you're repeating back consciously to yourself. So it's important to have them prepared and ready to go. So I often ask clients To kind of write them out and have them available. So that when that thought comes about, and it seems like you're pretty good at identifying, you know, what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you've memorized initially you'd read the automatic thought I mean, the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought. Okay, might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and I found that it changes how often and how intense to aback thoughts come in. Conscious thinking, adaptive responding, does that make sense?",story,64_160,T,id,
"That's us. Because like I said, I kind of said these things to myself anyway, I just didn't realize that's what was probably lessening the anxiety because I do say that things those things to myself pretty frequently when I say I have to go to work, or else you guys won't be able to take care of didn't even dawned on me that that's",routine,64_161,P,gc,
"you've already adapted Yeah, you've already used cognitive behavioral techniques, in a way to reduce anxiety. So what we're really doing is just expanding and formalizing what you've already been doing to achieve some success.",routine,64_162,T,orq,
"That makes sense. Definitely, yes.",routine,64_163,P,ack,
"So, if you could, between now and next session, write down some of the adaptive responses that we discussed the ones you've already used and, and then work to identify the automatic thoughts at work, and then come up, work to identify them, and then consciously repeat those, those that the responses back when you have those thoughts, okay, so you're really repairing self talk, adaptive responses, with the automatic thoughts, that thought comes right? And then you have the adaptive response. And you're repeating it, you know, it's an internal, you're pitting and just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud, although, that would surely be okay to not know, your coworkers, you know, respond something like that.",story,64_164,T,gc,
"Sorry. No. I mean, I've threatened to put a camera in the house. So I can like, there's a thing you can, you can remote access to your house, and there's a button your animal can push and call you. And I've talked to him at work. I'm like, Well, my cat calls me y'all. I really thought about it seriously, that I could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home, I could just look in and see what they're doing. I have thought that some of my co workers know I can't worry about them. So yeah, they would help support me and not be so anxious. Probably.",routine,64_165,P,cd,
"Yeah. And and putting in a security type measure. You could lessen anxiety, or it could create anxiety,",routine,64_166,T,od,
"but make it worse,",inactive,64_167,P,od,
"and I don't know which, you know. So I think if you're okay with it, we'll start with the adaptive responses. ",symp/reasoning,64_168,T,id,
"Yeah, I'd rather do that. ",inactive,64_169,P,ack,
"See how that works out. And we have other options. Putting security systems in such to shy out in the future if necessary. Let's try the adaptive responding. Then trying to keep track of how well it works for you like, what your what your thoughts and feelings were. After you applied it,",routine,64_170,T,gc,
should I like try to measure my level of anxiety? Absolutely. Okay.,routine,64_171,P,irq,
"Yeah. So you know, maybe like a one to 10 with 10 being the worst, okay, and measure it when you first had that experience of it. I'm pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately, you've experienced it for a long time. You suffer with it for a long time. And then after applying the adapter response, especially after a few minutes, applying a few times, maybe shoot for ones, see what it is that and note that, again, the beginning of might not see much of a change at all. Right? So be persistent with it. Okay. Give it a chance to work and see how it does. Okay. We'll start there and we'll kind of review how you do that. And then we'll work toward the things Analyze the bigger stressor right? And we'll see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that. Okay. So a good plan. Yes.",story,64_172,T,gc,
summary,"The patient has difficulty leaving home for extended periods of time like vacation. The patients explains a scenario where they are seen to have conflicting thoughts of to go and not to go. The patient has parents and pets to take care of. The patient gets worried if something might happen to them when they are away. The patient feels less anxious if they are busy at work since they can reach home but not the same during a vacation. The therapist confirms, depending on what the patient thinks, it can change the level of anxiety. The therapist advises to use self talk to overcome automatic thoughts of anxiety and discusses adaptive responses useful to the patient. The patient is asked to develop different adaptive responses and read the upside of adaptive response to counter the automatic thought and is requested to try this week and note the adaptive responses down. The therapist also request the patient to measure their anxiety levels.",,,,
