"Okay.  So from your family perspective, that Drinking is not something that fits very well. ",routine,139_92,T,gc,0
Yeah.,inactive,139_93,P,cd,0
"And with friends, you feel like it's easier to to hang out with alcohol. Or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much.",routine,139_94,T,gc,0
I guess it means this is just there.,inactive,139_95,P,gc,0

Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?,inactive,139_100,T,crq,0

"Okay, so the alcohol, something that might make it harder to reach your goals?",symp/reasoning,139_102,T,crq,0

"Yeah. So you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments?",routine,139_110,T,ack,0
"Yeah, definately that's a good thing.",inactive,139_111,P,id,0
"Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all important, not something you're thinking about. And 10 is the most important thing, ",routine,139_112,T,irq,0
maybe five or six.,symp/reasoning,139_113,P,id,0
And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?,routine,139_114,T,irq,0
Because it's not something I do not care about it all but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.,symp/reasoning,139_115,P,id,0
Okay. So It is something you have thought about.,inactive,139_116,T,ack,0
Yeah.,inactive,139_117,P,cd,0
And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?,routine,139_118,T,irq,0
"I'm pretty confident that I can, considering that I'm not really an alcohol user, per se. I'm not really into that whole scene, so it's gonna be difficult for me.",routine,139_119,P,id,1
So what number do you think you'd say?,routine,139_120,T,irq,0
"On a scale of one to 10, If I can quit alchohol?",routine,139_121,P,crq,0
Yeah,inactive,139_122,T,cd,0
maybe like an eight or nine.,routine,139_123,P,id,0
"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind. It sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments and you're drinking at some point.",routine,139_124,T,crq,0
Yes.,inactive,139_125,P,cd,0
" And it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself. And you actually feel very confident that you could be successful. With it, what sort of gold Do you think might be good to set for today?",routine,139_126,T,ack,0
"Um, probably to stop. Maybe next Friday I go to I have a drink at all. ",routine,139_127,P,gc,-1
Okay. Do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?,routine,139_128,T,yq,0
"Yeah, I mean, I can just tell my friends, my parent, my friends aren't really that pressuring. It's just like outside people that don't really know that well. So I could just tell them, Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.",routine,139_129,P,op,0
But what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?,routine,139_130,T,orq,0
"Definitely, I'll have like, all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.",routine,139_131,P,od,0

" Um, health concerns? I guess I know, alcohol is bad for your health. So that would be one.",routine,139_133,P,od,0

Okay. Do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if working out for you.,routine,139_136,T,orq,0
"Yeah, that would be okay.",inactive,139_137,P,od,0
"All right, great. And then it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.",routine,139_138,T,ack,0
Right.,inactive,139_139,P,gc,0
"Okay. Well, very good. Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? ",inactive,139_140,T,irq,0
How would you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?,symp/reasoning,139_141,P,id,0
"Oh, that's a great question. So a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking. And one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol. But of course, that's harder if you're not doing planning. So some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. Some of the things that I would recommend, since you're interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it. Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something. It kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you? ",routine,139_142,T,gc,0
"Yeah, for sure.",inactive,139_143,P,gc,0
Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it? Have you thought about how you might approach with them? Or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking?,routine,139_144,T,irq,0
"I was just planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That was me. Know, ",inactive,139_145,P,id,0
your friends would be pretty comfortable with that.,inactive,139_146,T,crq,0
"Yeah, I mean, that was my closest friends for sure. ",inactive,139_147,P,cd,0
"Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else? I go?",inactive,139_148,T,ack,0
" No, I think okay. ",inactive,139_149,P,gc,0
"Okay. So then, like I said, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going. And then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together. ",inactive,139_150,T,gc,0
Okay.,inactive,139_151,P,gc,0
Is that  Okay ?,inactive,139_152,T,gc,0
Yeah.,inactive,139_153,P,gc,0
