"I don't want to talk to you anymore. You're all the same. All of you. I have been wasting my time wasting my time. You're all, you're all the same. All you guys are exactly the same. You asked me to come in and just, I don't want to talk to you anymore because I come in here and I talk and I talk and I talk and talk and I don't get anything out of it. You're all the same.",symp/reasoning,11_0,P,com,
"When you say,",inactive,11_1,T,crq,
" You are all of you, all of you all therapy,",symp/reasoning,11_2,P,cd,
"Okay, I mean, I'm having a couple three reactions to what you're saying. I mean, one is that you're saying you're all the same and",inactive,11_3,T,irq,
we're all the same. You're all the same. In the for you guys. Nothing is working. Right. Nothing is working.,symp/reasoning,11_4,P,id,
"I mean, I'm feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now. ",inactive,11_5,T,crq,
"Well, you are because you're all the same. Of course, you're lumped in with everybody. I'm not gonna single you out. Not gonna make you you know, single you out because you're not doing anything. You don't do anything. There's all this abstract metaphysical stuff and there's no concrete. This is the way to fix it. This is the goal. There's nothing so what's the point?",story,11_6,P,com,
"I mean, it's there's something specific right now that I could say or do that that would fill, give you what you're wanting or need.",inactive,11_7,T,cd,
"How do I, how do you how do I go from point A to point B? How do I get better? How do I fix what's going on? I mean, that's the reason I came here. Right? I thought there was a reason I came here is to fix things. make things better.",story,11_8,P,orq,
"So you want sort of a, like a kind of, sort of like step by step description of",inactive,11_9,T,yq,
what something I need something to grab onto something to hold something Grab onto Yeah.,symp/reasoning,11_10,P,op,
"Yeah. See, my sense is that you know, that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to, to get to give you some sense of hope. And, and I really want to be able to, you know, to give you something but but it feels like there's something about the kind of intensity of your, of your sort of demand or play right now. Which, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need. Or, you know, a better way of putting it is, you know, have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us and there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation with Which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give",story,11_11,T,orq,
"just the way I am I always come out like that I always sway I get things. So the only way I get that's the only way I know how to be. I come out one of two ways. I come out either full, full throttle, just full, full tilt, just come out and just do it that way or I don't do anything at all. So it's like I one way and it's not good enough and on the other way and it's not good enough so ",story,11_12,P,od,
so it's like,inactive,11_13,T,ack,
"damned if you do damned if I do damned if I don't. If I go one way at everybody, it you know it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the Other and then if I'm just quiet and you know, just fall in with the crowd, it doesn't matter either. So",symp/reasoning,11_14,P,com,
"it sounds like it feels like you only have two choices, right that you can you can either approach the situation kind of on the attack, you know with with both guns blazing. It's a good way to describe",symp/reasoning,11_15,T,orq,
it both guns blazing.,symp/reasoning,11_16,P,in,
"Right or or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way. Right. Right. Have those two which, which feels better, which feels worse?",symp/reasoning,11_17,T,orq,
"Well, the bulk guns blazing always feels better because if I go at somebody with with, you know, full force and, you know, hit them over the head, you know, and just and just go at them. Even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter. Because I've already sent my face and so when I say, but if I don't say anything, I just sit back and don't do anything, then it just gets me as angry as the full guns blazing. So it just they eats me up, but it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I just blurt it all out and get it all out.",story,11_18,P,od,
"Right. Yeah, I can imagine that right that right, if you end up you know, at least if you're going in there with with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met. Right. But somehow they're, you know, sort of giving in, it's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way. So, I mean, you know, it seems to me that the you know, the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now, right. You sort of desperately need Something right, but a middle ground. There's no middle ground. Okay. So, you know, I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now. But I'm willing to work with you to, you know, to really work on discovering what that middle ground is. Does that does that seem worthwhile?",inactive,11_19,T,orq,
I have to have to find a middle ground.,symp/reasoning,11_20,P,op,
"Okay, but what are you feeling right now?",inactive,11_21,T,irq,
"Just it bothers me. I can't go one way or the other. It's like, try to do one thing. You can't do it and try to the other way. Can't do it. Just I'm just stuck.",symp/reasoning,11_22,P,id,
There's a real kind of sadness there.,inactive,11_23,T,yq,
yes,inactive,11_24,P,ack,
Look at me. The sense of what's what's going on for us? It sounds as if here. You're asking for something. Yeah.,inactive,11_25,T,orq,
I need something I can't get myself.,inactive,11_26,P,od,
"Yeah. Yeah, I, you know, I hear that I hear the, you know, you're sort of desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness. You know, when I'll do my best to help you",routine,11_27,T,gt,
