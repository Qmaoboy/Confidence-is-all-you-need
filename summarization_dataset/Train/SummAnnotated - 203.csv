"I went for that scan and then I was a bit surprised actually, they actually rang me up and a few days afterwards and said that I needed another scan to check things out. Okay, so I was there. It was on Monday this week. Don't let anything then.",story,203_5,P,id,
Okay. So in between the scan happening and the second scan happening Was it the department?,story,203_6,T,yq,

"No, they didn't actually I mean, I try to ask you always do and play sweet talk lady, but she was not pretending. ",story,203_9,P,on,
Okay. And I do have any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling back?,story,203_10,T,irq,
I guess it was gallstones.,story,203_11,P,id,
So just tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been having them but we do have a scan result here today and there's some scuffs on it.,symp/reasoning,203_12,T,irq,
Right.,inactive,203_13,P,ack,
"I just like to make sure that I know what's been happening to you first of all, and then we'll go into detail ",routine,203_14,T,id,

Yeah.,routine,203_16,T,ack,
"And then I saw your colleague, and he said we better get a scan. Yeah, I went for that scan. It was only about two weeks ago. And I got literally four or five days later. got the phone call? I needed this additional scan. So I went on Monday.",symp/reasoning,203_17,P,id,
Okay. Okay. And so do you still have pain at the abdomen?,symp/reasoning,203_18,T,irq,
"Yes. Yeah, it's just there all the time. ",symp/reasoning,203_19,P,id,
"Okay. Well, as I said, you scan result has come through to me today. ",symp/reasoning,203_20,T,id,
Yes,symp/reasoning,203_21,P,ack,
I'm afraid I'm afraid there is something that's potentially a little bit worrying on it.,symp/reasoning,203_22,T,id,
Really?,routine,203_23,P,crq,
Yeah.,routine,203_24,T,op,
So what's what's the worrying thing that you found?,routine,203_25,P,irq,
"Well, if I take you back to the first scan first. So what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland",symp/reasoning,203_26,T,id,
suspicious?,routine,203_27,P,crq,
"Yeah. So there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen, which is quite closely evolved, right, and called the pancreas. And when they did the ultrasound scan, which is a good scan, but isn't particularly detailed, right, there was something on it that they saw that they wanted a bit more info ",symp/reasoning,203_28,T,cd,
All right.,inactive,203_29,P,ack,
So that's why they called you back for the second scan,symp/reasoning,203_30,T,cd,
"That doesn't sound good, does they?",symp/reasoning,203_31,P,irq,
"which was a CT scan, which is a detail that we're likely to be talking about. ",symp/reasoning,203_32,T,id,
Right.,inactive,203_33,P,ack,
"So the second scan, I showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas.",symp/reasoning,203_34,T,id,
Really?,inactive,203_35,P,crq,
"When I say something, what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancer",routine,203_36,T,cd,
"god. I didn't expect that. God, I am only 47 cancer. ",routine,203_37,P,id,
"I'm really sorry to have to break it to you like this, but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you. So, I mean, I know that I've just dropped a big bombshell on you.",routine,203_38,T,id,
"Oh, yes. God",routine,203_39,P,gc,
Have you got any Any questions in a minute? Have you got anything that you can query?,routine,203_40,T,yq,
What's the pancreas and I have got cancer. What can I can make can they cut it out?,symp/reasoning,203_41,P,irq,
"And it depends. And basically a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen, as I said, and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body prefers the body. Because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem, like your pain that you've been getting. So that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms. ",symp/reasoning,203_42,T,id,
Right,routine,203_43,P,ack,
"And the answer is, I don't know what could be done about it. But we need to ask a specialist  what we usually do. This situation is asked especially today to see what has happened, think about what was cooking. Right? Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is",symp/reasoning,203_44,T,id,
Okay. Okay.,inactive,203_45,P,ack,
So I understand that I've just thrown a whole lot of information at you and,routine,203_46,T,id,
I just hasn't expected that so.,routine,203_47,P,id,
"I mean, is there is there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them? Oh, quit I went on a bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit. Bit more time.",routine,203_48,T,irq,
"I suppose I could love myself. No doubt come by myself actually. Yeah, okay. It will just be easier. Feel Sure. ",routine,203_49,P,id,
"I mean, I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is. We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what is right. So we do everything very quickly. Yeah, try and get some answers. Right. But we don't know any definite nothing certain in a minute. But I do appreciate that. I've just given you a little bit of time. So my door is open and yes. Okay. Have you got any questions?",symp/reasoning,203_50,T,yq,
No.,inactive,203_51,P,on,
"I've taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer, if that's what it is. ",symp/reasoning,203_52,T,id,
"Okay,",inactive,203_53,P,ack,
"some of it's a little bit a little bit scary. And as I said, we don't know, nothing certain yet. I wonder if you might want to come back to see me. So what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right? ",routine,203_54,T,id,
Okay.,routine,203_55,P,ack,
And it talks about cancer in general. The types of ways in which you can affect the pancreas,routine,203_56,T,id,

Yes.  Okay.,inactive,203_59,P,op,
"And then depending on what they find, yeah, it gives you a brief run through of the different types of treatment.",routine,203_60,T,id,
Okay,inactive,203_61,P,ack,
did you want to have a read through this and then Maybe tomorrow.,inactive,203_62,T,yq,
"Yeah, we like tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. I like this.",routine,203_63,P,id,
I'll see you tomorrow.,routine,203_64,T,id,
