Hi How are you doing today?,inactive,7_0,T,gt,
"I'm good. But um, there has been visual, you know, we will work out like my motivation. Sure. Kind of, it's kind of related to that. Um, so I'm in school. And every few weeks we have like papers to write. And I know I know what I know I can do it. It's just actually sitting down and doing it",symp/reasoning,7_1,P,gt,
ok will tell me about the papers.,symp/reasoning,7_2,T,irq,
"Well, they're usually about five pages long. And I just, I just look at it and like, it's five pages. But I'm like, okay, so I go sit down. You know, on my computer. I'm like, Alright, I'm starting references. So I get, I start off good. I do the references. But then it's like, I get sidetracked. tracked so easily. And then I end up killing like two hours, checking the news checking and then it goes to my phone and then just looking at recipes and then it gets really off topic and then I realized I haven't done anything.",symp/reasoning,7_3,P,id,
"Alright, so you, you have a five page paper, you sit down to work on it. You have the references, you get that part taken care of that then sounds like you kind of wander off a little bit. ",symp/reasoning,7_4,T,crq,
"Oh, big time. ",inactive,7_5,P,cd,
Yeah. Okay. And then what happens after you are done wandering a little bit?,routine,7_6,T,crq,
"I get kind of annoyed with it. And then I'm like, Well, you know, I've already you know, it's already 90 time I'll try to do it tomorrow. And then, you know, either tomorrow doesn't happen or the same thing happens. And it's just and then I end up rushing right at the edge of, you know, that's due tomorrow and getting all these five pages done. It's really hard for me",story,7_7,P,cd,
So you are you're finishing assignment on time. So the promise of lateness,symp/reasoning,7_8,T,crq,
"No, I, I get it done. ",symp/reasoning,7_9,P,cd,
You get done?,symp/reasoning,7_10,T,crq,
It's just all at the last minute.,symp/reasoning,7_11,P,cd,
So it's really the how the time breaks out isn't working out well for you.,symp/reasoning,7_12,T,crq,
Yeah.,inactive,7_13,P,cd,
You'd rather not be doing it at the last moment.,symp/reasoning,7_14,T,orq,
"No, I mean, I try not to. I mean, I set time aside to go sit down. I'm like, Alright, you know, we're gonna start on this paper. Then sidetracked. I'm watching TV. I'm on my phone. I'm on some other website.",story,7_15,P,od,
"So these so these activities that you're engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing, also regarding the references before you start writing. You said check an email. ",story,7_16,T,crq,
Yeah.,story,7_17,P,cd,
And other kind of sounds like unplanned small activities.,symp/reasoning,7_18,T,crq,
"Yeah. I mean, there's small things that keep My attention but it's not where my attention needs to go.",symp/reasoning,7_19,P,cd,
These aren't particularly engaging activities like something you need to do. No at that moment.,story,7_20,T,crq,
"No I mean, I look up you know, right I started one reference and then who this article looks cool who this article you know next thing I'm know I'm researching octopuses or something.",story,7_21,P,cd,
"So like distracted,",inactive,7_22,T,orq,
yeah distracted like at work.,symp/reasoning,7_23,P,od,
And then there's a moment you kind of catch yourself and realize you haven't really started writing.,story,7_24,T,crq,
"Yeah, but it's like two hours late",symp/reasoning,7_25,P,cd,
"is too late. Yeah, so you're consuming time there. Alright. So you have a few different levels of activity. Here you have the paper, which it sounds like you're okay writing but you're you're maybe not highly motivated to write. ",symp/reasoning,7_26,T,crq,
"Okay, ",inactive,7_27,P,cd,
but you seem to be getting the references done. Okay.,symp/reasoning,7_28,T,crq,
"Yeah, I mean, I get some references done. Okay.",symp/reasoning,7_29,P,cd,
"You collect the material, and then the writing part. That's the difficult part. And then you have these behaviors. In the middle, which you enjoy doing a little, but they're not something that",story,7_30,T,crq,
"I mean, they're not something I'm like am jumping for joy about it's just something to to procrastinate. So I don't have to do my paper. And I don't think that I you know, I'm not like, Oh, I need to check my email so I don't have to do my paper. It's just, Oh, I should check my email. Oh, I should check my phone. Oh, I haven't done this one Oh, I haven't seen this in a while.",story,7_31,P,cd,
But these behaviors still fulfill purpose they they do delay the writing of the paper.,story,7_32,T,crq,
"Yeah, that's true. ",inactive,7_33,P,cd,
"You may not be fully aware of that in a moment. But then you kind of become aware of that later that that's the purpose that those behaviors accomplished was that they kept you distracted from writing. Alright. So the the writing of papers and activity, that's a behavior that's something you're not really looking forward to. What's the behavior That was an activity that you really do look forward to, you know, think about and some level of engagement is there.",story,7_34,T,crq,
"Well, there is this new TV show out that they just started a new season. And I have it all recorded, like 24 episodes. But I can't find time to watch it. But I'm really, you know, I've seen the first season I'm so interested in it. And I'm can't wait to see the next one. I guess that that would that's, I guess what makes me really happy right now.",story,7_35,P,cd,
So so you're excited about this television show and you how you have the episodes already recorded. And maybe one of the reasons you can't find the time is because the time you're using between the two parts of writing this paper.,story,7_36,T,crq,
"Yeah. I mean, this paper is taking me a lot longer than it should.",story,7_37,P,cd,
"Right. So let's let's try this. When you when you do write to paper, you're really writing it. The writing part, not the preparing part, but the writing part kind of all at the end. Right, getting it done this the night before it's due. All right. So I want to try a couple different behavioral strategies here. Okay. And these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation. One is I think that it might be helpful and I want you let me know if I'm right here to break if it's a five page paper to break it up into more than one night. Because right now, functionally, at least a lot of what you're doing on the last night, okay. would be a more comfortable pace like Like, for example, how long does it take you to write one page?",symp/reasoning,7_38,T,orq,
"out an hour, hour and a half?",symp/reasoning,7_39,P,crq,
So around an hour to an hour and a half? You can complete one page. Edited proof read?,inactive,7_40,T,cd,
Yeah.,inactive,7_41,P,ack,
"Okay. So it would take about five days. To complete the whole paper, if you did an hour and a half each day, an hour to one I haven't checked. Okay. But how much time do you have from when the papers assigned to when it's due?",story,7_42,T,crq,
"They give us about a week and a half to do,",story,7_43,P,cd,
I guess around 10 days. Yeah.,story,7_44,T,crq,
"Um, I guess around six o'clock, like, because then I'm already done eating home from work. And I've kind of de stressed already. Six o'clock looks like a",story,7_45,P,cdd,
"pretty good time. So if you could work without distraction, you would be done by around 730 at the latest with this one page.",story,7_46,T,irq,
"Yeah, what the one page Okay, so",story,7_47,P,id,
"no distractions. Just one page. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about the the episodes, the TV episodes that you want to watch. Okay? How long are they,",story,7_48,T,gc,
"they're an hour to an hour, okay?",story,7_49,P,gc,
"And once a time that you could watch those, you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching, like no distractions, I guess, ",story,7_50,T,gc,
"I guess around eight o'clock because that's when I'm you know, started getting ready for bed and starting to like really relax. And, you know, my husband's home by that time and we can watch it together. He loves the show too.",story,7_51,P,gc,
"Okay. So eight o'clock, so really good time for you to maximize",story,7_52,T,gc,
"married. And that's a great,",story,7_53,P,gc,
"you know, that's a great motivator for you. And I want to try to use it as a motivator. Kind of like a reward. Okay, so I'd like you to try to do is when you start, like when you get all these papers assigned when the five, five page papers, pick the five nights that you want to work on it. Okay, it could be Monday through Friday or whatever works for you. ",symp/reasoning,7_54,T,ci,
Okay.,inactive,7_55,P,ack,
"All right, clearly within the 10 day window, though, all right, so five days within the 10 day window, do you have to turn in and then set that time at six o'clock is when you're going to start because that's a good time for you to work.",symp/reasoning,7_56,T,ci,
So let's keep thinking about that when I feel like I'm getting off track.,symp/reasoning,7_57,P,crq,
"Yeah, that's sure.",inactive,7_58,T,cd,
Yeah. and not have to stress right at the end.,routine,7_59,P,crq,
"Yeah. And not waste that time in the middle. Yeah. Right. That's, that's really eating more time and your show takes",routine,7_60,T,cd,
I see where you're gonna. Absolutely.,routine,7_61,P,ack,
"Does this make sense to you understand kind of,",routine,7_62,T,yq,
"yeah, you know, that helped me power through and not do things unrelated by you think well, if I get this paper done This page doesn't need to watch my show later.",routine,7_63,P,ack,
"And I think that's a that's a helpful way to think about it. And that's, that's the cognitive part of this. So this is a kind of this is a behavioral strategy because we've talked about these in the past, right? This is behavioral strategy, the cognitive pieces, when you find yourself wandering, I think you have to detect that. And you I think you have some level awareness that's happening. Yeah, you have to detect that and say, I want to watch my show, and we're looking forward to it. ",routine,7_64,T,gc,
Okay.,inactive,7_65,P,ack,
"And that's your motivation to move through the paper. And then you know, when eight o'clock comes, okay.",inactive,7_66,T,orq,
"All right, that sounds like a plan. All right.",inactive,7_67,P,od,
Very good. So let's try that for. I'll see again in roughly two weeks.,routine,7_68,T,ci,
Yep. All right. Thank you. So a few weeks.,inactive,7_69,P,ack,
All right. Thank you. Thanks.,inactive,7_70,T,gt,
summary,"The patient wishes to work out motivation to write papers. The paper is five pages long and they start with references. Once they complete the references, they get sidetracked easily. The patient ends up killing two hours of their time and rush to do everything at the last minute. The therapist clarifies the patient is not highly motivated to write. The therapist suggests to break down five page paper into five days and pick the evenings at six o' clock in the 10 day window when they wish to do. The patient could reward themselves if they are successful by watching their favorite TV show in the night which will be a great motivator. The therapist explains this is cognitive part of behavioral strategy and confirms to meet again in roughly two weeks.",,,,
