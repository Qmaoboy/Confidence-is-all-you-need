"Okay, Charles, let's take a look at your homework from last week the activity schedule.",symp/reasoning,78_0,T,id,
Not very much on it.,symp/reasoning,78_1,P,id,
"I'll take a look at it and see, well, you did complete most of it.",symp/reasoning,78_2,T,id,
"I don't see the point. And I mean, how do you master watching TV or eating a meal? I, if I had tried to use chopsticks, I suppose it would have some mastery involved in but I, I didn't mess with chopsticks, okay. Food was okay. Hmm. But not, not great. Okay.",story,78_3,P,id,
"So it was tough. And I just want to be clear, though, Charles that this is very typical though for many people that we work with. It's very difficult to complete homework worksheets, because things happen, right? I don't feel that Well, sometimes things get in the way. There's things that just prevent me from doing that. So I think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult. So what would you say what would be some barriers that made it difficult to Your mastery ratings.",routine,78_4,T,id,
"I don't enjoy anything. And I used to I used to enjoy it a lot of things. But I don't even I don't look forward to breakfast, particularly cup of coffee. The news is mostly bad and what if there is news? I mean, the paper doesn't carry much national news anymore. So, I mean, I have to eat, but I really don't see the point of a lot of things.",story,78_5,P,id,
"Okay. Okay. Well, I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things. versus the cons. So there's a worksheet that I have called a decisional balance worksheet. And it basically takes two separate decisions. One decision is to engage in activities, and there's some benefit to doing that. And then another decision would be to not engage in activities. There's benefit to that. But there's also cost to both of those decisions. So I think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there's more benefit or cost to completing that? What do you think about that?",story,78_6,T,id,
"Well, that would depend on the activity. I know but okay. I could, I could get in touch with somebody I could call a friend. Maybe try to meet somebody for lunch.",routine,78_7,P,id,
"Okay, that's a great idea. So what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch?",symp/reasoning,78_8,T,irq,
"Well, I would, I would enjoy the company. Okay, and wouldn't be as lonely I suppose.",symp/reasoning,78_9,P,id,
"Okay, that sounds great. So sounds like one benefit would be you'd enjoy the company. Yeah. And you wouldn't be as lonely. So I'd write that down. Okay, good.",routine,78_10,T,ack,
"Company company and said not as lonely not only. That's good, okay.",routine,78_11,P,id,
"Okay, can you think of the downside to potentially doing that?",routine,78_12,T,irq,
"Well, one downside might be that he wouldn't be interested in having lunch with me. I haven't been a whole lot of fun lately. And, or he might be busy and might not not might not be able to have lunch.",story,78_13,P,id,
"Okay, or",inactive,78_14,T,ack,
he might want to talk about what's going on in my life and I'm ready We don't want to talk about that let somebody talk about it with you course. Okay.,story,78_15,P,id,
So it sounds like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy.,routine,78_16,T,id,
Right? That could be the downside. Is that right? Okay. might not be able to come. Sure.,routine,78_17,P,yq,
"Okay. So I'd write that is a great job Charles with the top two boxes with the first decision. So let's move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same and there's some benefit to that and there's some cost to that as well. Sure. Okay, Charles, so we completed the worksheet. So what's your overall impression about the benefits of changing versus the cons and staying the same?",routine,78_18,T,id,
"Well, it makes sure that the, the benefits outweigh the cons. If, if I make the change if I don't make the change I'll be doing just what I've been doing and I'll be getting up wondering, what's the point? And well still be lonely. And",symp/reasoning,78_19,P,id,
"Those are good observations, Charles. So, which activity doesn't make the most sense to try for homework this week?",routine,78_20,T,yq,
"Well, I call somebody I think, Okay.",routine,78_21,P,ack,
"Okay, that's a good observation. So, let's say for homework, then you tried to call someone to get together with a friend. And how about also trying to complete a full day of the activity schedule, and completing both the mastery and the pleasure ratings? What do you think about that?",symp/reasoning,78_22,T,orq,
Sure. Okay.,routine,78_23,P,od,
"Okay. And if it gets Difficult, which again, that's pretty normal for that to take place. If it gets hard, we can talk about it next time and we can problem solve together and figure out how to remove those barriers. Does that sound good?",routine,78_24,T,yq,
"Sure. Okay, okay.",inactive,78_25,P,op,
summary,The therapist discusses patient's last week homework schedule. The patient is disinterested to carry out the activities. The therapist explains that it is a decisional balance worksheet and request to weigh pros and cons for each activity.
