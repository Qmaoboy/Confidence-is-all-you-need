I want you to be an active part of putting this together. So as I throw out some ideas, let me know if it's something that makes sense to you or doesn't. Okay? I'd like to start by having you explain in depth kind of what you're going through at work. I know it's troubling you and I want to hear that story. Then you're going to look for some patterns in the way you're thinking And see if there's something that I recognized all that something I can point out, that may help you a bit. And we'll get more to that later. And then to kind of as we wrap up with towards the end, maybe start getting some ideas of things you can do between sessions between now and we'll see you next time that can help combat these symptoms make you feel better. Okay. Does that seem like a fairly straightforward agenda? Any changes or anything you'd like to make to that?",routine,128_6,T,id,

And, you know, I've been doing it for a while now, not too long, but about five years. And overall, I like my job and everything. But just, you know, something happened at work, and it just really kind of, I just feel like, one minute, everything was fine. And now, it just feels like everything's really out of control. So, you know, I was just, you know, doing my normal job making reports and everything like that. And, you know, I made a report about this family that I felt, you know, maybe the children weren't getting quite What they needed, they seemed malnourished The house was really unclean. You know, I suspected that the parents were using drugs there, and it's just really not a good environment. And, you know, turns out that the kids were taken away. And, you know, the family. It just unlike really freaked out, you know, maybe the kids aren't doing well. They're away from their parents, even though it wasn't a great environment. I know that the kids really love their parents, and it's just, it's really, really weighing on me and it's become kind of like a really big issue at work. I guess we're like, everybody knows about it. And, you know, I just feel like I tore this family apart. And I don't know if I made the right decision. And I just, it's like, you know, I used to just, I used to be so confident in what I did. And now I just feel like I'm second guessing everything.",story,128_9,P,id,-2
