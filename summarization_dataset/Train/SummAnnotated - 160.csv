I know,symp/reasoning,160_8,T,gc,0
"I don't want to be late because then what if I get in trouble. So it's already kind of on edge. And then we passed the accident that I guess was causing off the traffic. And there were two cars and they were like, mashed together like accordions, and there was a tarp. And I know that under that tarp, there was a dead body, and the car went right. by it.

I can't see my friends anymore if I'm dead.,story,160_19,P,gc,-2
"True. That's true. And I won't get to see you anymore. Because you're dead. You know, I don't treat dead people right. Remember that? Yeah, okay. So on one hand, I know the idea of driving is completely overwhelming. And I know you're anxious, like all the time.",symp/reasoning,160_20,T,gc,0
"And I get that I have to drive because you're right. It's like the middle of nowhere. And I can't just, like, not go places, but ",symp/reasoning,160_21,P,gc,-2
"so I'm wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things you're talking about to help reduce your anxiety. Maybe that's one idea to help you be able to get in the driver's seat. What do you think? So, essentially, you're practicing getting the driver seat by like doing this treatment and get in the driver's seat of your anxiety, as opposed to being a passenger and you're letting anxiety outside really your life? Because that's what you're doing. What do you think?",symp/reasoning,160_22,T,gc,0
"There's a lot of puns, Jen.",symp/reasoning,160_23,P,id,-1

True.,symp/reasoning,160_28,T,gc,0
there's no way to like can't you're supposed to like just make it go away. You're not supposed to make it worse to make it better.,symp/reasoning,160_29,P,gc,-2

"No,  you know that",symp/reasoning,160_37,P,id,0
"live with your parents for the rest of your life. I know I forgot. So you can live with your parents for the rest of your life. Because you're too anxious to leave town you won't be able to drive. So you could just live with your parents be anxious all the time, and you could go home so ideas on how to maintain your anxiety the rest of your life. You won't need to learn to drive. I mean, your parents are fairly nice. They probably drive around for the rest of your life, you know, until they pass away or something. In the meantime, what about that?
