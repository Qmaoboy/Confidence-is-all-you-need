"So Charles, it sounds like things have been going pretty well recently,",inactive,89_0,T,id,
"but they've been going better. Yeah, they have good I did call a friend. And we had lunch. I'd seen this guy in two or three years and it was good to see him when we contacted again and agreed we maybe have lunch. From time to time, that'd be good. And I got back in the kitchen, I made this pretty good soup. It's an asparagus potato soup that sounds very it's it's really good to chop up the asparagus and the potatoes and one small onion and boil them and then use a blender to give it a real nice texture, texture a little bit like split pea soup, sounds good without a split pea and so on. feeling some better. ",story,89_1,P,id,
"That's good. That's good. Charles, I'm proud of you for taking the initiative. Because I know it's been difficult in the past and you've really championed the things we've talked about, and I'm really proud of you for that. One thing you didn't mention was the woodworking shop that we've talked about in the past is that has that been?",routine,89_2,T,id,
"Well, that's still a mess. Okay, in fact, it's a it's a it's it's a big mess. It's such a mess that I really can't get in there and do any work. I haven't done that for some time. Okay. Every surface every why we got to work benches and",routine,89_3,P,cd,
"Kinda Okay, well as we've talked about in the past, it's really difficult to get started on some things that we've avoided for quite some time. So, like in the past, let's brainstorm. Try to figure out how we can get some some movement in the woodworking shops. That sound good. Sure. Okay, so so one thing we've discussed in the past, Charles is extremely important is what you're thinking about as you're going into the woodworking shop. So, what are your thoughts? When you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop? What do you think?",story,89_4,T,irq,
"Well, when I stand there in it, and I feel helpless, I mean it. It's hopeless, it seems to me that okay, just get it back in shape again.",symp/reasoning,89_5,P,id,
"Okay, so let's explore that. So. So what's the evidence that it's hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop?",symp/reasoning,89_6,T,irq,
"Well, just the mess that it is. I mean, that how disorganized and",symp/reasoning,89_7,P,id,
"Okay, so it sounds like you're saying then it's disorganized. And it's a mess.  So how do you feel when you think about the woodworking shop that way?",routine,89_8,T,orq,
"hopeless, okay, I think just",routine,89_9,P,od,
"Okay. So it prevents you from actually getting things done is what you're saying? Yes. Okay. Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way to Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I'm probably They're not gonna do anything, which makes sense. So, so what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop? That would actually be helpful? What's another way?",story,89_10,T,irq,
"Well, if I could get one workbench cleaned off, okay, I would have some space to work on.",routine,89_11,P,id,
"Okay, that's a really good start.",routine,89_12,T,id,
"Well, I could make some things that I've been thinking about making for some time. Okay, I kind of have the plans in my head. Okay. I've thought about a medieval, kind of small medieval catapult for my grandson. And maybe Boomerang made out of really nice laminated wood, that would be cool. And so I could get one or both of those built, perhaps.",story,89_13,P,id,
Okay? And what would that lead to? If you get those things built? What would you have to do anything with those things?,routine,89_14,T,irq,
"Well, if I if I built those, I would have to get in the car and drive for hours today. Okay, my grandkids where my grandkids are and to give them the, the toys, okay, and show them how it works and have shown how to throw the boomerang.",story,89_15,P,id,
"So it sounds like there's a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids so you'd be able to see them and spend time with with them, you'd feel better about going to do that. But you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that basically what you're saying would Yeah, okay, sure. But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. Right? That wouldn't change overnight. So I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids. So how about we talked about the first step, which sounds like would be to just move things off one bench? Does that sound right?",story,89_16,T,id,
"Yeah, that Yeah, one.",routine,89_17,P,ack,
Okay. That sounds great.,inactive,89_18,T,acak,
Though.,inactive,89_19,P,gc,
So let's talk about that. Then let's let's sketch out what each day would look like so that we won't won't feel overwhelmed like we did in the past. So let's talk about each day and how we would sketch out each day Does that sound good?,routine,89_20,T,yq,
Sure.,inactive,89_21,P,op,
