"Okay, so now what I'm writing down here is kind of like what we talked about how there's no family situation, you know thought and you have an emotion.

"So when he when he has these, he kind of gets upset at you for certain things like this. How do you think you could change from the smacking him to having a more calm and positive response?",story,192_38,T,gc,0
"I think if I was able to get the same thing,",story,192_39,P,od,-3
how do you think you might be able to do that?,routine,192_40,T,orq,0
Umm,routine,192_41,P,od,0
"Like, this is how we would do it with CBT we would change your thought. So what He gets upset with you and calls you selfish. You start to feel selfish.",routine,192_42,T,gc,0

Maybe the time I did die and I felt like awful but now like he says the wording for money but we're really not one might want to pay our bills or I want to do things i mean he's just kind of like a cheap person. We have plenty of money to we're not hurting at all and I do not feel confidence I don't think it was selfish to make myself feel prettier you know? But I think people do have their selfish tendencies.,symp/reasoning,192_47,P,od,-3
So I'm hearing you say is you don't think you're selfish at all.,routine,192_48,T,crq,0
"Oh, I mean, I'm Selfish actuation you don't know if you're being selfish? I really, I really don't know if I had gone and bought a whole new wardrobe with it, but man, I just did my hair. And he had pizza real estate agent. They had sold a big house that week, so we had enough money for me to afford it. Okay,",symp/reasoning,192_49,P,cd,-3
"so instead of thinking I'm selfish, what could you actually think?",routine,192_50,T,irq,0
I deserve this and then how me sometimes,routine,192_51,P,id,-3
I deserve this?,inactive,192_52,T,crq,0
Yeah.,inactive,192_53,P,cd,0
"I mean, who doesn't deserve something every now and then. Right? ",inactive,192_54,T,gc,0
Yeah.,inactive,192_55,P,ack,0
"Okay, so if you were thinking I deserved that. That was your thought when he was getting angry. He thought no, I'm sorry. This How do you think that would actually Make you feel what kind of emotion would you feel at that point? I drives you so confident?",routine,192_56,T,ap,0
"Yeah, confident in my decision. I would still feel real sad that paint off But I don't think it would be to the level that it was thought was selfish.",routine,192_57,P,od,-3
"So if you felt competent about your decision, because you actually changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually get an angry you would think there's no need for this?",routine,192_58,T,orq,0
"Yeah, I think it would help me realize that that's his issue and not mine",routine,192_59,P,gc,-3
Right. So how do you think you'd actually behave them?,routine,192_60,T,irq,0
"walk off, okay or he will  be able to  This is kind of what I'm wanting to get to, as well be able to suppress it and No, man He didn't deserve for me to hit him. He didn't. He said something that upset me, but no one deserves that.",routine,192_61,P,id,-3
"Right. So maybe I'm so thinking also that you're selfish when he's getting my back. Could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me, he just doesn't understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this. And explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself. ",routine,192_62,T,gc,0
"Yeah, yeah, I could try that. ",routine,192_63,P,cr,0
"Because, you know, you know, you're not selfish. It's just something that makes you feel good. ",routine,192_64,T,gc,0
"And I think also, he understood why I did it. Because I mean, he knows that I have some subconscious issues, but I don't think he realizes how bad it was or why I got my hair cut encasing it as she said the most girly things you never asked me feel better about myself, you know, not be as well.
