"Hello stone, ",inactive,10_0,T,gt,
yes.,inactive,10_1,P,gt,
"Hi, I'm PJ Daniels. Sorry, let me wash my hands.",inactive,10_2,T,gc,
"Call me, Dorothy.",inactive,10_3,P,gc,
"Oh, thank you. That's the next thing I was going to ask you. So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what's going on?",symp/reasoning,10_4,T,irq,
"Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency. And they treated me by putting this tube down my throat. And I tried to, to tell them and gesture at them that I don't want this tube down my throat. And I just hope that never happens again.",symp/reasoning,10_5,P,id,
"Okay. No, I totally understand that. I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through. And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked it. Talk to me about this. So I had a little bit of a look through your charts. I think I understand why they did it. But did anybody explain it to you?",routine,10_6,T,crq,
"Well, not really. And because I was gasping for air and in the state I was, but I'll tell you what, I'm really worried that this won't happen to me again. I don't want that to be anymore. I'm, I'm okay to to pass this. ",routine,10_7,P,cd,
"Absolutely. And you know what? There's no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive, like the two, we really want to know what the patient values in terms of, you know, things that are that invasive, and so absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want. But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital.",routine,10_8,T,irq,
"Well, I have congested Part failure. And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly. So I was living in my soul, the ambulance brought me in to the emergency. So they that was how they were treating me.",symp/reasoning,10_9,P,id,
So you pretty much showed up to emergency. And very quickly they put that tube down.,symp/reasoning,10_10,T,crq,
That's correct.,inactive,10_11,P,cd,
Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that?,routine,10_12,T,crq,
"Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don't want the tube but",routine,10_13,P,cd,
they didn't quite pick up on that.,inactive,10_14,T,crq,
"I guess not. And, you know, I've had that three times already. I don't want to go through with",symp/reasoning,10_15,P,cd,
the two you've had.,inactive,10_16,T,crq,
Yes. I don't want it anymore.,inactive,10_17,P,cd,
"Okay. And so so you have congestive heart failure, and it sounds like you've got a breathing problem. Yes. And do you know why they would have put the tube down. Do you know what they were trying to do?",inactive,10_18,T,orq,
"I guess because I was short of air. I had a hard time breathing, right? So they tried to, like, I'm going to use the word save me.",symp/reasoning,10_19,P,od,
"Right. So it sounds like you understand that. I mean, usually we only put a tube in. If that was the only thing we could do to save you. Most of the time of congestive heart failure. We'll give some medications. Have you heard of lasix? Or furosemide? No, okay. It's a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don't think we have time to give it that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. haven't had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.",story,10_20,T,orq,
"I I guess so. But I'm okay with dying. Okay. You know, like I says, I've lived a good life and if it If the good Lord says that it's my time, I'm okay with that. And you wouldn't put it to",story,10_21,P,od,
"No, my know already what I'm hearing from you. Exactly. I'm just gonna say exactly what you've said, sounds like you've lived a good life. You've been through this a few times, you know exactly what it involves. And if I could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage. Is that correct?",story,10_22,T,crq,
"That is correct. And, but you know, what, doctor? How can I be assured that my wishes are respected, so I don't get this tube down?",routine,10_23,P,cd,
"That's an excellent question. So first, I did want to answer your previous question, based on what we're talking about. Absolutely. I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then of course, your second question, which is great, as well as how do we make sure this doesn't happen? So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too. And your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care. And I just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. And that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing to so I reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that to Okay.",story,10_24,T,orq,
"All Thank you. I'm I was so concerned about that and yes, I I think I will rest now because like I say, that was a horrendous experience. And he says it won't happen again.",inactive,10_25,P,od,
"Okay. I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this. Go ahead. And the first question might sound a little off putting, but I sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want. We do have to ask, how was your mood? How are you feeling?",inactive,10_26,T,irq,
I'm I'm feeling fine. My mood is fine. I have no no problems.,story,10_27,P,id,
" Okay, excellent. And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital? Like when you're healthy as healthy as you can be? Say a few weeks ago?",inactive,10_28,T,irq,
"I think I am enjoying life. Okay. Yes, I am enjoying life to the to the best I can. ",inactive,10_29,P,id,
"Okay, great. Yeah. And then other related questions, we did talk about the two that we wouldn't put it in. But again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want. Okay? So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have?",inactive,10_30,T,crq,
"Certainly, Oh, yes. Oh, look at medication, just not the intubation.",symp/reasoning,10_31,P,cq,
"Okay. And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone just found you at home, who had passed away. Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life?",story,10_32,T,irq,
"No, no, no, I like I said, the good Lord knows when it's my time.",symp/reasoning,10_33,P,id,
"No, and that'll make sense to me with no breathing.",inactive,10_34,T,crq,
"Yes, and I have no problems with that.",inactive,10_35,P,cd,
"There are some other things we can do. That's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive. And one is have you ever heard of bipap?",story,10_36,T,yq,
I don't think so.,inactive,10_37,P,on,
"It's a mass that really pushes air into you. It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube. Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don't know what that is. But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time,",routine,10_38,T,id,
would it be for a long time?,routine,10_39,P,irq,
"Now, usually, most times with bipap? It's only about two to six hours for most patients.",routine,10_40,T,id,
"Yeah, that would be okay with me. Okay. And if",symp/reasoning,10_41,P,ack,
"we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff, and take you to the intensive care unit. Again, we wouldn't do breathing too, but this is just to watch you closely.",inactive,10_42,T,gc,
"Yeah, I would be okay with that. Yes, yes. It doesn't sound invasive to me.",inactive,10_43,P,gc,
Okay.,inactive,10_44,T,ack,
"No, I just needed to be reassured that that it won't happen again. And and yeah, I'm, I know that on my chart. It's there. Yes, yes. And that's all I need to hear because I was concerned. Okay. ",routine,10_45,P,od,
"I do want to say that this is not set in stone, in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again. But if we don't hear from you, this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart. I just want you to know that in case anything were to change,",routine,10_46,T,ci,
"okay. So if I change my mind, I can I will talk to you. ",inactive,10_47,P,op,
Absolutely.,inactive,10_48,T,ack,
I don't think I'll change.,inactive,10_49,P,gc,
"I don't think you will either. But it's just nice to see that you're aware of that. Okay. Um, honestly, I mean, there's some other questions. I tend to ask people when I don't know them. Well, just kind of routine stuff. Okay. And maybe we'll just quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure Anything else?",routine,10_50,T,irq,
"Um, that's it. I'm beginning with an ass but I can't remember what it is.",routine,10_51,P,id,
"Okay, that's okay. We can usually we have it written down. Yeah, your medications. I think I saw you're on aspirin and two jocks and I think two others. Do you happen to know or have them written down?",routine,10_52,T,irq,
You don't want I always carry this paper with me because I can't remember the name. So okay.,inactive,10_53,P,id,
"Oh, so you are on the water pill? The furosemide. Okay, ",routine,10_54,T,yq,
yes.,inactive,10_55,P,ack,
"And. Okay, great. Yeah. Um, any allergies? ",routine,10_56,T,yq,
No.,routine,10_57,P,on,
"Okay. And I won't ask but anything that runs in your family, given your age, they told me you're 70 Is that correct? ",routine,10_58,T,yq,
That is correct.,routine,10_59,P,ack,
Yes. And I do have to ask the following Questions completely unrelated to what we're talking about. That's okay. Do you smoke at all?,routine,10_60,T,irq,
"No, I don't ",routine,10_61,P,id,
drink any alcohol.,routine,10_62,T,irq,
"No, no. ",routine,10_63,P,id,
"Okay. And this will be sound crazy, but I have to ask any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that?",routine,10_64,T,irq,
"No, I never had the opportunity",routine,10_65,P,id,
to test any over the counter herbals In addition to these.,routine,10_66,T,crq,
"No, I don't take any of those. ",routine,10_67,P,cd,
And where are you living right now.,routine,10_68,T,irq,
"I'm living in a convalescent home for the last six months. I used to live in my own home. And six months ago, I'm moved to a convalescent home.",routine,10_69,P,id,
Okay. And how do you feel about that? That changed six months ago.,routine,10_70,T,irq,
"I would really prefer my own home. But just trouble with my breathing sometimes, right?",routine,10_71,P,id,
So you feeling better about being in that place now? A new home,routine,10_72,T,orq,
"It's okay. Okay, I really have to adjust. Like I say, if I had my druthers, I'd go back but I guess I have to learn to adjust to this right. Okay.",routine,10_73,P,od,
So I think I sort of have all the information I need to make sure that your wishes are respected. Just one last time. Anything else you want to talk about today?,routine,10_74,T,yq,
"Oh, you answered my question. I was so worried about this tube. ",inactive,10_75,P,op,
"Okay. All right. Well, it's very nice to meet you and Stone.",inactive,10_76,T,gt,
Thank you.,inactive,10_77,P,gt,
