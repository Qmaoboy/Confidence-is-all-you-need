I haven't been, you know, irritable or anything during the day and at night, I get a few artists late, but the rest of the time I'm like, you know, either working on work or my house or whatever. So I mean, I've slept like in less but it's not an issue.",story,50_5,P,id,

And I had bought, like I said, my new China and I got some kitchen utensils too and a couple things for around the house like home decor. And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything I was at the mall. So I was hitting a lot of different stores. And I've run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get a new dining room set like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet and he has an SUV. So I called him to see if he could come in so I could purchase the items but he said he wasn't he couldn't come out and I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money. Which I don't know. I don't know why he would be just from me calling him but I think that's why he was concerned it but he didn't come I didn't get the dining room set or anything.",story,50_13,P,ack,
