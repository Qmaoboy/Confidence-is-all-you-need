"Hmm, yup",inactive,197_19,P,cd,
"Sandra, having just explore some of your feelings around the situation you have, I'm going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair. This may be a little uncomfortable. But it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer, and you'll be in dialoguing with a party that you are actually having to deal with. And I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change process okay. It's been Jeff and your imagination that the massive Jeff we're here. I'll bring a chair. Okay. Welcome, Jeff. I mean I welcome Jeff. And, and there's Jeff. Imagine his face looks like how you remember him and bring him in and your fantasy. And then when you're ready to just say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneous.",symp/reasoning,197_20,T,id,
"Jeff, I feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the children in. I think you understand how hard it is at times and the things that I have to explain to them about about this situation. It bothers me that you don't go out of your way to spend extra time with the children and I really believe that in the future, they, they will come to, to really resent that and, and not look at you as as their father, I, I honestly can't understand why you don't want to spend more time with them. And irrespective of what's happened between between us and and you moving on and, and so forth. I just don't think that that your children and my children should really suffer in that way. we'd like them to have as as normal a life as possible and, and be able to, to be with both of their parents and why you know what is so important rather than them wanting to be with them. It's it's just very hard. ",symp/reasoning,197_21,P,id,
"Okay. Okay, so there's a kind of question you understand why this happened, etc. Right? So what next thing we'll do, you'll sit over there, and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at. That maybe a little bit difficult But let's do a dialogue as if he were he's not here anyway. ",routine,197_22,T,id,
Yeah.,routine,197_23,P,ack,
"So we'll, we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, imaginary Jeff, and you in the present here and now. Okay. And what is what is he saying? I know they're the hurts and frustration a but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father.",routine,197_24,T,id,
"I really don't have any appreciation for that because the reason the reason that you've given that you're busy, like I'm busy in my life and I still give our children priority, they still take precedence in my life. And I just don't think that that, that that's right ",routine,197_25,P,id,
Actually what kind of father you should be for the children?,routine,197_26,T,irq,
"You should be proactive in wanting to save them. And I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than then what we have agreed is there are times when when you Want to do something spontaneous and and see then then then feel free to contact us and, and see if it's okay.",routine,197_27,T,id,
"Sounds like a very good idea. Good offer you Jeff, are you prepared to take that off for the kids sake? Its great go your way what's what's going on here? The contracts happening okay. Seems Parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important. That's the children. So children will not suffer, they will actually benefit from that agreement, if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how we're going to take care of the children. Because the thing no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple separate together, the contract life countries, I'm still my father to my children as a mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out, we can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together and even if you don't, they don't live together. We would live for the with the kids they'd be happy. Does that make sense to you?",routine,197_28,T,id,
Yes.  This is in a counseling session. And He hasn't really participated in informing his contract.,routine,197_29,P,id,
"But you hear that this happened for you. And you've done it. So is there something that the now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter how he is? Because there's now a new realization that the children need that. Father and Mother. How's that for you? ",routine,197_30,T,irq,
"Yeah, maybe I just need to let him know that And just extend the invitation of having more time out there. Yeah. Yeah,",routine,197_31,P,id,
you're good at that. You're very good. Who's watching you working here? You're very good at creating contracts and very clear about what you want. And it's a question of how you can the two parties can get to that agreement together. What do you think?,routine,197_32,T,irq,
Yeah,inactive,197_33,P,ack,
"Great, because that's, this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen.",inactive,197_34,T,ack,
