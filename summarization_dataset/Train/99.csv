"it was, it was better than 1000 mile service. And I thought, well, I'm doing this for the right reasons. I know that, but who knows, they might find something totally wrong with me. And that's the way I found out so it's a win win situation, I believe. Yeah. And you know that if they do accept you, and I was the oldest one that they've ever had this and it'll last 20 years.
