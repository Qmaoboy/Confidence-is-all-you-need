No. it's not. It's not the drug right? This is doesn't matter how my face I get this. Constantly. Yes. always there.,inactive,209_105,P,id,
"Okay, I guess the reason I was checking I think we've picked up on is sometimes when people are having the kinds of experiences that you are they find if they take certain drugs, it could make things feel a lot worse. I just wanted to check. that hadn't been your experience.",story,209_106,T,yq,
No,inactive,209_107,P,on,
"Okay, okay. Appreciate from what you're saying, You're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. I just wanted to check with you Do you think it could be due to anything else? And I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences, and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be mentally unwell, and it's worth it whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment.",symp/reasoning,209_108,T,gc,
"No, because I'm not ill. ",symp/reasoning,209_109,P,id,
Alright.,inactive,209_110,T,gc,
"It's them and I've read books on this as well. I don't the government know about the them to know that they do this to loads of people. I don't know how they can get away with it. I have done nothing wrong, I don't know why they're doing this to me. ",story,209_111,P,gc,
"Okay. Sure, I think I can appreciate that. I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment?",story,209_112,T,irq,
"I don't know. I mean, I want to hear really, because someone warmer, tried to. I don't want to worry about I've tried to talk to her about it. She doesn't understand she doesn't really believe me. I mean, do you believe me? ",story,209_113,P,id,
"Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment, I guess I'm not too sure about is what's causing this and I'm, I'm less sure this is due to MI5 is what I'm wondering, is it perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment. I mean, we've been through a lot of questions And what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this Someone drink cuz I know your mom is I think she's waiting in the waiting room might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some some proper support. Would that be alright if I got your mum in?",symp/reasoning,209_114,T,id,
"Okay, ",inactive,209_115,P,ack,
"okay, if you want to sit there then I'll just get your mum okay.",inactive,209_116,T,gc,
