Some of the best-known genres of American music are rhythm and blues, jazz, rock and roll, rock, soul, hip hop, pop, and country. The history began with the Native Americans, the first people to populate North America. \nWith the colonization of America from European countries like France, Spain, Scotland, England, Ireland, and Wales came Christian choirs, musical notation, broadsides, as well as West African slaves.  West African slaves played a variety of instruments, especially drums and string instruments similar to the banjo. The Spanish also played a similar instrument called the Bandora. Both of these cultures introduced polyrhythms and call-and-response style vocals.\nAs the United States incorporated more land, spreading west towards the Ocean, more immigrants began to arrive in the country, bringing with them their own instruments and styles.  During this time, the United States grew to incorporate the Cajun and Creole music of Louisiana, the Polynesian music of Hawaii and Tex-Mex and Tejano music.  Immigrants brought with them the Eastern European polka, Chinese and Japanese music, and Polish fiddling, Scottish and Irish music, Ashkenazi Jewish klezmer, and other styles of Indian, Russian, French, German, Italian, Arab and Latin music.\nIn the 21st century, American popular music achieved great international acclaim.  Even since the ragtime and minstrel songs of the 19th century, African Americans have greatly influenced American popular music.  The rural blues of poor black Southerners and the jazz of black urbanites were among the earliest styles of American popular music.  At the time, black performers typically did not perform their own material, instead using songs produced by the music publishing companies of Tin Pan Alley.  African American blues evolved during the early 20th century, later evolving to create genres like rhythm and blues.  During this time, jazz diversified into steadily more experimental fields.  By the end of the 1940s, jazz had grown into such varied fields as bebop and jazz.\nRock and roll was soon to become the most important component of American popular music, beginning with the rockabilly boom of the 1950s.  In the following decade, gospel evolved into secular soul.  Rock, country and soul, mixed with each other and occasionally other styles, spawned a legion of subgenres over the next few decades, ranging from heavy metal to punk and funk.  In the 1970s, urban African Americans in New York City began performing spoken lyrics over a beat provided by an emcee; this became known as hip hop music.  By the dawn of the 21st century, hip hop had become a part of most recorded American popular music, and by the 2010s had surpassed rock music in overall listenership.\n\nAmerican roots music\nThe first musicians anywhere in North America were Native Americans, who consist of hundreds of ethnic groups across the country, each with their own unique styles of folk music.  Of these cultures, many, and their musical traditions, are now extinct, though some remain relatively vibrant in a modern form, such as Hawaiian music.\nBy the 16th century, large-scale immigration of English, French and Spanish settlers brought new kinds of folk music.  This was followed by the importation of Africans as slaves, bringing their music with them.  The Africans were as culturally varied as the Native Americans, descended from hundreds of ethnic groups in West Africa.  American music is, like most of its hemispheric neighbors, a mixture of African, European and a little bit of native influences.  Still later in the country's history, ethnic and musical diversity grew as the United States grew into a melting pot of different peoples.  Immigration from China began in large numbers in the 19th century, most of them settling on the West Coast.  Later, Japanese, Indian, Scottish, Polish, Italian, Irish, Mexican, Swedish, Ukrainian and Armenian immigrants also arrived in large numbers.\nThe first song copyrighted under the new United States Constitution was The Kentucky Volunteer, composed by a recent immigrant from England, Raynor Taylor, one of the first notable composers active in the US, and printed by the most prolific and notable musical publisher of the country's first decade, Benjamin Carr.\n\nAfrican American music\nIn the 19th century, African-Americans were freed from slavery following the American Civil War.  Their music was a mixture of Scottish and African origin, like African American gospel displaying polyrhythm and other distinctly African traits.  Work songs and field hollers were popular, but it was spirituals which became a major foundation for music in the 20th century.\nSpirituals (or Negro spirituals, as they were then known) were Christian songs, dominated by passionate and earthy vocals similar to the church music of Scotland, which were performed in an African-style and Scottish style call-and-response format using hymns derived from those sung in colonial New England choirs, which were based on Moravian, English and Dutch church music.  These hymns spread south through Appalachia in the late 18th century, where they were partnered with the music of the African slaves.  During the Great Awakening of religious fervor in the early 19th century, spirituals spread across the south.  Among some whites, slave music grew increasingly popular, especially after the American Civil War, when black and white soldiers worked together and Southern slaves fled north in huge numbers.\nBy the end of the 19th century, minstrel shows had spread across the country, and even to continental Europe.  In minstrel shows, performers imitated slaves in crude caricatures, singing and dancing to what was called \"Negro music\", though it had little in common with authentic African American folk styles.  An African American variety of dance music called the cakewalk also became popular, evolving into ragtime by the start of the 20th century.\n\nAppalachian folk music\nThe Appalachian Mountains run along the East Coast of the United States.  The region has long been historically poor compared to much of the rest of the country; many of the rural Appalachian people travelled to cities for work, and were there labeled hillbillies, and their music became known as hillbilly music.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants arrived in large numbers.  They mingled there with poor whites of other ethnic backgrounds, as well as many blacks.  The result was a diverse array of folk styles which have been collectively referred to as Appalachian folk music.  These styles included jug bands, honky tonk and bluegrass, and are the root of modern country music.\nAppalachian folk music began its evolution towards pop-country in 1927, when Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family began recording in a historic session with Ralph Peer (Barraclough and Wolff, 537).  Rodgers sang often morbid lyrical themes that drew on the blues to create tales of the poor and unlucky (Collins, 11), while the Carters preferred more upbeat ballads with clear vocals, complementary instrumentation and wholesome lyrics (Garofalo, 53).  Their success paved the way for the development of popular country, and left its mark on the developing genre of rock and roll.\n\nOther forms of American roots music\nThough Appalachian and African American folk music became the basis for most of American popular music, the United States is home to a diverse assortment of ethnic groups.  In the early 20th century, many of these ethnic groups supported niche record industries and produced minor folk stars like Pawlo Humeniuk, the \"King of the Ukrainian Fiddlers\" (Kochan and Kytasty, 308).  Some of these ethnic musicians eventually became well known across the country, such as Frankie Yankovic, the Slovenian polka master.\nThis same period also saw the rise of Native American powwows around the start of the 20th century.  These were large-scale intertribal events featuring spiritual activity and musical performances, mostly group percussion based (Means, 594).\nLarge-scale immigration of Eastern European Jews and their klezmer music peaked in the first few decades of the 20th century.  People like Harry Kandel and Dave Tarras become stars within their niche, and made the United States the international center for klezmer (Broughton, 583).\nIn Texas, ethnic Mexicans who had lived in the area for centuries, played a distinct style of conjunto, different from that played in Mexico.  The influence of Czech polka music was a major distinguishing characteristic of this music, which gradually evolved into what is now known as norte\u00f1o (Burr, 604).\nThe Cajuns and Creoles of Louisiana have long constituted a distinct minority with their own cultural identity.  The Cajuns are descendants of French-Canadians from the region of Acadia, the Creoles are black and French-speaking.  Their music was a mixture of bluesy work songs mixed with jazz and other influences, and included styles like la la and jur\u00e9.  Though these genres were geographically limited, they were modernized and mixed with more mainstream styles, evolving into popular zydeco music by the middle of the century (Broughton and Kaliss, 558).\n\nBeginnings of popular music\nThe first field of American music that could be viewed as popular, rather than classical or folk, was the singing of the colonial New England choirs, and travelling singing masters like William Billings.  It was here that techniques and traditions like shape note, lined-out hymnody and Sacred Harp were created, gradually spreading south and becoming an integral part of the Great Awakening.  The Great Awakening of the 1730s and \u201940s was a period of religious fervor, among whites and blacks (both slave and free), that saw passionate, evangelical \"Negro spirituals\" grow in popularity (Ferris, 98).\n\nDuring the 19th century, it was not spirituals that gained truly widespread acclaim, but rather peppy comic songs performed by minstrels in blackface, and written by legendary songwriters like Stephen Foster and Daniel Emmett.  During the Civil War, popular ballads were common, some used liberally by both the North and the South as patriotic songs.  Finally, late in the century, the African American cakewalk evolved into ragtime, which became a North American and European sensation, while mainstream America was enthralled by the brass band marches of John Philips Sousa.\n\nTin Pan Alley was the biggest source of popular music early in the 20th century (Garofolo, 17).  Tin Pan Alley was a place in New York City which published sheet music for dance songs like \"After the Ball Is Over\".  The first few decades of the 20th century also saw the rise of popular, comic musical theater, such as the vaudeville tradition and composers and writers like Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin.  At the same time, jazz and blues, two distinct but related genres, began flourishing in cities like Memphis, Chicago and New Orleans and began to attract some mainstream audiences.\nBlues and jazz were the foundation of what became American popular music.  The ability to sell recorded music through phonographs changed the music industry into one that relied on the charisma of star performers rather than songwriters.  There was increased pressure to record bigger hits, meaning that even minor trends and fads like Hawaiian steel guitar left a permanent influence (the steel guitar is still very common in country music).  Dominican merengue and Argentinian tango also left their mark, especially on jazz, which has long been a part of the music scene in Latin America.  During the 1920s, classic female blues singers like Mamie Smith became the first musical celebrities of national renown.  Gospel, blues and jazz were also diversifying during this period, with new subgenres evolving in different cities like Memphis, New York, New Orleans and Chicago.\nJazz quickly replaced the blues as American popular music, in the form of big band swing, a kind of dance music from the early 1930s.  Swing used large ensembles, and was not generally improvised, in contrast with the free-flowing form of other kinds of jazz.  With swing spreading across the nation, other genres continued to evolve towards popular traditions.  In Louisiana, Cajun and Creole music was adding influences from blues and generating some regional hit records, while Appalachian folk music was spawning jug bands, honky tonk bars and close harmony duets, which were to evolve into the pop-folk of the 1940s, bluegrass and country. The American Popular music reflects and defines American Society.\n\n1940s and 1950s\nIn the 1940s, jazz evolved into an ever more experimental bebop scene. Country and folk music further developed as well, gaining newfound popularity and acclaim for hard-edged folk music.\n\nThe dawn of rock & roll\nStarting in the 1920s, Boogie Woogie began to evolve into what would become rock and roll, with decided blues influences, from 1929's \"Crazy About My Baby\" with fundamental rock elements to 1938's \"Roll 'Em Pete\" by Big Joe Turner, which contained almost the complete formula. Teenagers from across the country began to identify with each other and launched numerous trends. Perhaps most importantly, the 1940s saw the rise of the youth culture. The first teen stars arose, beginning with the bobby soxer idol Frank Sinatra; this opened up new audiences for popular music, which had been primarily an adult phenomenon prior to the 1940s. In the 1940s, boogie woogie was using terms like \"rocking\" and \"rolling\" borrowed from gospel and blues music, as in \"Good Rockin' Tonight\" by Roy Brown. In the 1950s, rock and roll musicians began producing direct covers of boogie woogie and R&B stars, for example \"Shake Rattle and Roll\" by Big Joe Turner (covered by Bill Haley and his Comets in 1954) and \"Hound Dog\" by Big Mama Thornton (covered by Elvis Presley in 1956), and their own original works like Chuck Berry's \"Maybellene\" in 1955.\n\nRoots of country music\nThe early 1940s saw the first major commercial success for Appalachian folk.  Singers like Pete Seeger emerged, in groups like the Almanac Singers and The Weavers.  Lyrically, these performers drew on early singer-songwriters like Woody Guthrie, and the whole scene became gradually associated with the political left (Garofolo, 196).  By the 1950s, the anti-Communism scare was in full swing, and some performers with a liberal or socialist bent were blacklisted from the music industry.\nIn the middle of the 1940s, Western swing reached its peak of popularity.  It was a mixture of diverse influences, including swing, blues, polka and popular cowboy songs, and included early stars like Bob Wills, who became among the best known musicians of the era.\nWith a honky tonk root, modern country music arose in the 1940s, mixing with R&B and the blues to form rockabilly.  Rockabilly's earliest stars were Elvis Presley and Bill Haley, who entertained to crowds of devoted teenage fans.  At the time, black audiences were listening to R&B, doo wop and gospel, but these styles were not perceived as appropriate for white listeners.  People like Haley and Presley were white, but sang in a black style.  This caused a great deal of cheeze controversy from concerned parents who felt that \"race music\", as it was then known, would corrupt their children.  Nevertheless, rockabilly's popularity continued to grow, paving the way for the earliest rock stars like Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard and Fats Domino.\nAmong country fans, rockabilly was not well-regarded.  Instead, the pop sounds of singers like Hank Williams and Patsy Cline became popular.  Williams had an unprecedented run of success, with more than ten chart-topping singles in two years (1950\u20131951), including well-remembered songs still performed today like \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" and \"Cold, Cold Heart\".  It was performers like Williams that established the city of Nashville, Tennessee as the center of the country music industry.  There, country and pop were mixed, resulting in what was known as the Nashville Sound.\n\nGospel and doo wop\nThe 1950s also saw the widespread popularization of gospel music, in the form of powerful singers like Mahalia Jackson.  Gospel first broke into international audiences in 1948, with the release of Jackson's \"Move on Up a Little Higher\", which was so popular it could not be shipped to record stores fast enough. As the music became more mainstream in the later part of the decade, performers began adding influences from R&B to make a more palatable and dance-able sound. Early in the next decade, the lyrics were secularized, resulting in soul music. Some of soul's biggest stars began performing in the 1950s gospel scene, including Sam Cooke, Dinah Washington, Dionne Warwick and Aretha Franklin.\nDoo wop, a complex type of vocal music, also became popular during the 1950s, and left its mark on 1960s soul and R&B. The genre's exact origins are debatable, but it drew on groups like the Mills Brothers and The Ink Spots, who played a kind of R&B with smooth, alternating lead vocals. With the addition of gospel inflections, doo wop's polished sound and romantic ballads made it a major part of the 1950s music scene, beginning in 1951. The first popular groups were The Five Keys (\"Glory Of Love\") and The Flamingos (\"Golden Teardrops\"). Doo wop diversified considerably later in the decade, with groups like The Crows (\"Gee\"), creating a style of uptempo doo wop and the ballad style via The Penguins (\"Earth Angel\"), while singers like Frankie Lymon became sensations; Lymon became the first black teen idol in the country's history after the release of the Top 40 pop hit \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" (1956).\n\nLatin music\nLatin music imported from Cuba (chachach\u00e1, mambo, rumba) and Mexico (ranchera and mariachi) had brief periods of popularity during the 1950s.  The earliest popular Latin music in the United States came with rumba in the early 1930s, and was followed by calypso in the mid-40s, mambo in the late 1940s and early 1950s, chachach\u00e1 and charanga in the mid-50s, bolero in the late 1950s and finally boogaloo in the mid-60s, while Latin music mixed with jazz during the same period, resulting in Latin jazz and the bossa nova fusion cool jazz.\nThe first Mexican-Texan pop star was Lydia Mendoza, who began recording in 1934.  It was not until the 1940s, however, that musica norte\u00f1a became popularized by female duets like Carmen y Laura and Las Hermanas Mendoza, who had a string of regional hits.  The following decade saw the rise of Chelo Silva, known as the \"Queen of the (Mexican) Bolero\", who sang romantic pop songs.\nThe 1950s saw further innovation in the Mexican-Texan community, as electric guitars, drums and elements of rock and jazz were added to conjunto.  Valeria Longoria was the first major performer of conjunto, known for introducing Colombian cumbia and Mexican ranchera to conjunto bands.  Later, Tony de la Rosa modernized the conjunto big bands by adding electric guitars, amplified bajo sexto and a drum kit and slowing down the frenetic dance rhythms of the style.  In the mid-1950s, bandleader Isidro Lopez used accordion in his band, thus beginning the evolution of Tejano music.  The rock-influenced Little Joe was the first major star of this scene. Classical music has also been influenced by Latin musicians since the begin of the 20th. century by composers such as Miguel del Aguila and Astor Piazzolla\n\nCajun and Creole music\nLouisiana's Cajun and Creole communities saw their local music become a brief mainstream fad during the 1950s.  This was largely due to the work of Clifton Chenier, who began recording for Speciality Records in 1955.  He took authentic Cajun and Creole music and added more elements of rock and roll: a rollicking beat, frenetic vocals and a dance-able rhythm; the result was a style called zydeco.  Chenier continued recording for more than thirty years, releasing over a hundred albums and paving the way for later stars like Boozoo Chavis and Buckwheat Zydeco.\n\n1960s and 1970s\nIn the 1960s, music became heavily involved in the burgeoning youth counter culture, as well as various social and political causes.  The beginning of the decade saw the peak of doo wop's popularity, in about 1961, as well as the rise of surf, girl groups and the first soul singers.  Psychedelic and progressive rock arose during this period, along with the roots of what would later become funk, hip hop, salsa, electronic music, punk rock and heavy metal.  An American roots revival occurred simultaneously as a period of sexual liberation and racial conflict, leading to growth in the lyrical maturity and complexity of popular music as songwriters wrote about the changes the country was going through.\n\nEarly 1960s\nThe first few years of the 1960s saw major innovation in popular music.  Girl groups, surf and hot rod, and the Nashville Sound were popular, while an Appalachian folk and African American blues roots revival became dominant among a smaller portion of the listening audience.  An even larger population of young audiences in the United Kingdom listened to American blues.  By the middle of the decade, British blues and R&B bands like The Beatles, The Who and the Rolling Stones were topping the charts in what became known as the British Invasion, alongside newly secularized soul music and the mainstreaming of the Bakersfield Sound.  Folk-based singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan also added new innovations to popular music, expanding its possibilities, such as by making singles more than the standard three minutes in length.\n\nPsychedelic rock\nPsychedelic rock became the genre most closely intertwined with the youth culture.  It arose from the British Invasion of blues in the middle of the decade, when bands like The Beatles, Rolling Stones  The Yardbirds and The Who dominated the charts and only a few American bands, such as The Beach Boys and The Mamas & the Papas, could compete.  It became associated with hippies and the anti-war movement, civil rights, feminism and environmentalism, paralleling the similar rise of Afrocentric Black Power in soul and funk.  Events like Woodstock became defining symbols for the generation known as the Baby Boomers, who were born immediately following World War 2 and came of age in the mid to late 1960s.\nLater in the decade, psychedelic rock and the youth culture splintered.  Punk rock, heavy metal, singer-songwriter and progressive rock appeared, and the connection between music and social activism largely disappeared from popular music.\nAmong the key venues that promoted psychedelic rock were the Matrix, the Avalon Ballroom, Fillmore Auditorium and the Berkeley Community Theater in San Francisco, The Family Dog Denver, the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, Whisky A-Go-Go and Kaleidoscope in Los Angeles, and Cafe Au Go Go in New York.\n\nSoul and funk\nFrom 1960s to 1970s, female soul singers like Aretha Franklin, and female pop singer Dionne Warwick and Diana Ross were popular, while innovative performers like James Brown invented a new style of soul called funk.  Influenced by psychedelic rock, which was on the charts at the time, funk was a very rhythmic, dance-able kind of soul.  Later in the decade and into the 1970s, funk too split into two strands.  Sly & the Family Stone made pop-funk palatable for the masses, while George Clinton and his P Funk collective pioneered a new, psychedelic funk. In 1970s Kool & the Gang and the Ohio Players were popular.  Album-oriented soul also appeared very late in the decade and into the next, with artists like Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Curtis Mayfield taking soul beyond the realm of the single into cohesive album-length artistic statements with a complex social conscience.\nIt was in this context, of album-oriented soul and funk, influenced by Black Power and the civil rights movement, that African Americans in Harlem invented hip hop music.\n\nCountry and folk\nMerle Haggard led the rise of the Bakersfield Sound in the 1960s, when the perceived superficiality of the Nashville Sound led to a national wave that almost entirely switched country music's capital and sound within the space of a few years.  At the same time, bluegrass became a major influence on jam bands like Grateful Dead and also evolved into new, progressive genres like newgrass.  As part of the nationwide roots revival, Hawaiian slack-key guitar and Cajun swamp pop also saw mainstream success.\n\nTejano\nWith the widespread success of Tony de la Rosa's big band conjunto in the late 1950s, the style became more influenced by rock and pop.  Esteban Jordan's wild, improvised style of accordion became popular, paving the way for the further success of El Conjunto Bernal.  The Bernal brothers' band sold thousands of albums and used faster rhythms than before.\n\n1970s\nThe early 1970s saw popular music being dominated by folk-based singer-songwriters like John Denver, Carole King and James Taylor, followed by the rise of heavy metal subgenres, glam, country rock and later, disco.  Philly soul and pop-funk was also popular, while world music fusions became more commonplace and a major klezmer revival occurred among the Jewish community.  Beginning in the early 1970s, hip hop arose in New York City, drawing on diverse influences from both white and black folk music, Jamaican toasting and the performance poetry of Gil Scott-Heron.\n\nHeavy metal\nHeavy metal's early pioneers included the British bands The Yardbirds  Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, though American cult bands Blue Cheer and The Velvet Underground also played a major role.  Their music was hard-edged and bluesy, with an often menacing tone that became more pronounced in later subgenres.  In the beginning of the 1970s, heavy metal-influenced glam rock arose, and musicians like David Bowie became famous for gender-bending costumes and themes.  Glam was followed by mainstream bombastic arena rock and light progressive rock bands becoming mainstream, with bands like Styx and Chicago launching popular careers that lasted most of the decade.  Glam metal, a glitzy form of Los Angeles metal, also found a niche audience but limited mainstream success.\n\nOutlaw country\nWith the Bakersfield Sound the dominant influence, outlaw country singers like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings were the biggest country stars of the 1970s, alongside country rock bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman Brothers Band who were more oriented towards crossover audiences.  Later in the decade and into the next, these both mixed with other genres in the form of heartland rockers like Bruce Springsteen, while a honky tonk revival hit the country charts, led by Dwight Yoakam.\n\nHip hop\nHip hop was a cultural movement that began in Bronx in the early 1970s, consisting of four elements.  Two of them, rapping and DJing, make up hip hop music.  These two elements were imported from Jamaica by DJ Kool Herc.  At neighborhood block parties, DJs would spin popular records while the audience danced.  Soon, an MC arose to lead the proceedings, as the DJ began isolating and repeating the percussion breaks (the most popular, dance-able part).  MCs' introductions became more and more complex, drawing on numerous African-derived vocal traditions, and became the foundation of rapping.  By the end of the decade, hip hop had spread across the country, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nSalsa\nCuban and Puerto Ricans in New York invented salsa in the early 1970s, using multiple sources from Latin America in the pan-Latin melting pot of the city.  Puerto Rican plena and bomba and Cuban chachacha, son montuno and mambo were the biggest influences, alongside Jamaican, Mexican, Dominican, Trinidadian, Argentinian, Colombian and Brazilian sources.  Many of the earliest salsa musicians, like Tito Puente, had had a long career in various styles of Latin music.  Salsa grew very popular in the 1970s and into the next two decades, spreading south to Venezuela, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Peru and especially Cuba.\n\nPunk rock\nPunk rock arose as a reaction against what had come before.  Early punks believed that hollow greed had destroyed American music, and hated the perceived bombasity and arrogance of the biggest bands of the 1970s. It arose in London and New York, with numerous regional centers by the end of the decade when acts like Ramones and Patti Smith saw unprecedented success for their defiantly anti-mainstream genre. It was the British band The Clash, however, that became wildly popular, more so in the UK than the U.S., and set the stage for adoption of elements of punk in popular music in the 1980s.\n\n1980s and 1990s\nThe 1980s began with new wave dominating the charts, and continued through a new form of silky smooth soul, and ended with a popular glam metal trend dominating mainstream America.  Meanwhile, the first glimmer of punk rock's popularity began, and new alternative rock and hardcore found niche markets.  Hip hop diversified as a few artists gained mainstream success, finally breaking through in the last few months of the decade.\n\nHip hop\nIn the 1980s, hip hop saw its first taste of mainstream success with LL Cool J and Kurtis Blow.  Meanwhile, hip hop was continuing its spread from the East Coast to most major urban areas across the country, and abroad.  At the end of the decade, two albums broke the genre into the mainstream.  Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back and N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton broke through with highly controversial and sometimes violent lyrics.  N.W.A proved especially important, launching the career of Dr. Dre and the dominant West Coast rap sound of the next decade.  That same year (1989), De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising became the earliest release of alternative hip hop, and numerous regional styles of hip hop saw their first legitimization, including Chicago hip house, Los Angeles electroclash, Miami's bass, Washington, D.C.'s go-go and Detroit's ghettotech. Drawing inspiration from the rebellious attitudes of the Civil Rights Movement and groups like Public Enemy, many intelligent and politically minded rappers began what is known as underground hip-hop with artists like Boots Riley from The Coup leading the way.\n\n1990s\nAs the 1990s began, hair metal was dominating the charts, especially formulaic bands like Extreme.  In reaction to that, the first few years saw a sea change in American popular music.  Nirvana's Nevermind along with Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden launched the defiantly anti-mainstream grunge movement  among mainstream audiences, while Dr. Dre's The Chronic brought his West Coast G Funk sound to widespread success.\nBoth these trends died out quickly, however, grunge done in by Kurt Cobain's death and disillusionisment with grunge, a form of alternative rock, becoming mainstream.  G Funk lasted a few years, displacing East Coast rap as the dominant sound of hip hop.  A rivalry began, fed by the music news, focusing on West Coast's Tupac Shakur and the East Coast's Notorious B.I.G.  By the middle of the decade, Tupac and Biggie were shot dead, and Dr. Dre's Death Row Records had fallen apart.  East Coast rappers like Puff Daddy, 50 Cent and Busta Rhymes re-established the East Coast, while Atlanta's OutKast and other performers found a mainstream audience.\n\nAlanis Morissette, one of the top-selling artist of the 1990s, injected renewed popularity to singer-songwriters such as Tori Amos, Jewel, and Sarah McLachlan. In the wake of grunge and gangsta rap came a fusion of soul and hip hop, called neo soul, some popularity for British Britpop and the rise of bands like Sublime and No Doubt, playing a form of pop punk influenced by Jamaican ska and British two tone ska/punk fusionists from the early 1980s.  Techno also became popular, though nowhere's near as much so as in most of the rest of the world.\nAt the turn of the millennium, bubblegum pop groups like Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears were dominating the charts, many of them with a Latin beat (Shakira, Ricky Martin), and rappers like Jay-Z and Eminem were huge stars.  Some garage rock revivalists like The White Stripes and The Hives became highly hyped bands in the indie rock field, and achieved substantial mainstream success.  The first few years of the 2000s saw the further rise of pop-hip hop, fed by the breakthrough success of Eminem.  Indeed, hip hop became an essential element of nearly all popular music during this period, resulting in new fusions like nu metal.  Pop thug rappers like Ja Rule were nationally renowned, though hard-edged hip made a return within a few years with the rise of 50 Cent. Politically minded hip hop in the tradition of Public Enemy and Boogie Down Productions has also diversified since the early 1990s with groups like The Coup, Sweatshop Union, Mr. Lif, Paris, Immortal Technique and many others.\n\nReferences\nSee also\nMusic history of the United States in the 1950s\nMusic history of the United States in the 1960s\nMusic history of the United States in the 1970s\nMusic history of the United States in the 1980s\nMusic history of the United States in the 1990s\nMusic history of the United States in the 2000s\nMusic history of the United States in the 2010s\nMusic history of the United States in the 2020s"], "Ground_truth": "The musical style ragtime, flourished and peaked popularity in the united states between 1895 and 1919.

Food consists of macromolecules of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that need to be broken down chemically by digestive enzymes in the mouth, stomach, pancreas, and duodenum, before being able to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Initial breakdown is achieved by chewing (mastication) and the use of digestive enzymes of saliva. Once in the stomach further mechanical churning takes place mixing the food with secreted gastric acid. Digestive gastric enzymes take part in some of the chemical process needed for absorption. Most of the enzymatic activity, and hence absorption takes place in the duodenum.\nDigestive enzymes are found in the digestive tracts of animals (including humans) and in the tracts of carnivorous plants, where they aid in the digestion of food, as well as inside cells, especially in their lysosomes, where they function to maintain cellular survival.\nDigestive enzymes are classified based on their target substrates: lipases split fatty acids into fats and oils;\nproteases and peptidases split proteins into small peptides and amino acids;\namylases split carbohydrates such as starch and sugars into simple sugars such as glucose,\nand nucleases split nucleic acids into nucleotides.\n\nTypes\nDigestive enzymes are found throughout much of the gastrointestinal tract. In the human digestive system, the main sites of digestion are the mouth, stomach, and small intestine. Digestive enzymes are secreted by different exocrine glands including salivary glands, gastric glands, secretory cells in the pancreas, and secretory glands in the small intestine. In some carnivorous plants plant-specific digestive enzymes are used to break down their captured organisms.\n\nMouth\nComplex food substances that are eaten must be broken down into simple, soluble, and diffusible substances before they can be absorbed. In the oral cavity, salivary glands secrete an array of enzymes and substances that aid in digestion and also disinfection. They include the following:\n\nLingual lipase: Lipid digestion initiates in the mouth. Lingual lipase starts the digestion of the lipids/fats.\nSalivary amylase: Carbohydrate digestion also initiates in the mouth. Amylase, produced by the salivary glands, breaks complex carbohydrates, mainly cooked starch, to smaller chains, or even simple sugars. It is sometimes referred to as ptyalin.\nLysozyme: Considering that food contains more than just essential nutrients, e.g. bacteria or viruses, the lysozyme offers a limited and non-specific, yet beneficial antiseptic function in digestion.\nOf note is the diversity of the salivary glands. There are two types of salivary glands:\n\nSerous glands: These glands produce a secretion rich in water, electrolytes, and enzymes. A great example of a serous oral gland is the parotid gland.\nMixed glands: These glands have both serous cells and mucous cells, and include sublingual and submandibular glands. Their secretion is mucinous and high in viscosity.\n\nStomach\nThe enzymes that are secreted in the stomach are gastric enzymes. The stomach plays a major role in digestion, both in a mechanical sense by mixing and crushing the food, and also in an enzymatic sense, by digesting it. The following are enzymes produced by the stomach and their respective function: \n\nPepsin is the main gastric enzyme. It is produced by the stomach cells called \"chief cells\" in its inactive form pepsinogen, which is a zymogen. Pepsinogen is then activated by the stomach acid into its active form, pepsin. Pepsin breaks down the protein in the food into smaller particles, such as peptide fragments and amino acids. Protein digestion, therefore, primarily starts in the stomach, unlike carbohydrate and lipids, which start their digestion in the mouth (however, trace amounts of the enzyme kallikrein, which catabolises certain protein, is found in saliva in the mouth).\nGastric lipase: Gastric lipase is an acidic lipase secreted by the gastric chief cells in the fundic mucosa of the stomach.  It has a pH level of 3\u20136. Gastric lipase, together with lingual lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases. These lipases, unlike alkaline lipases (such as pancreatic lipase), do not require bile acid or colipase for optimal enzymatic activity. Acidic lipases make up 30% of lipid hydrolysis occurring during digestion in the human adult, with gastric lipase contributing the most of the two acidic lipases. In neonates, acidic lipases are much more important, providing up to 50% of total lipolytic activity.\nCathepsin F: is a cysteine protease.\n\nPancreas\nPancreas is both an endocrine and an exocrine gland, in that it functions to produce endocrinic hormones released into the circulatory system (such as insulin, and glucagon), to control glucose metabolism, and also to secrete digestive/exocrinic pancreatic juice, which is secreted eventually via the pancreatic duct into the duodenum. Digestive or exocrine function of pancreas is as significant to the maintenance of health as its endocrine function.\nTwo of the population of cells in the pancreatic parenchyma make up its digestive enzymes:\n\nDuctal cells: Mainly responsible for production of bicarbonate (HCO3), which acts to neutralize the acidity of the stomach chyme entering duodenum through the pylorus. Ductal cells of the pancreas are stimulated by the hormone secretin to produce their bicarbonate-rich secretions, in what is in essence a bio-feedback mechanism; highly acidic stomach chyme entering the duodenum stimulates duodenal cells called \"S cells\" to produce the hormone secretin and release  to the bloodstream. Secretin having entered the blood eventually comes into contact with the pancreatic ductal cells, stimulating them to produce their bicarbonate-rich juice. Secretin also inhibits production of gastrin by \"G cells\", and also stimulates acinar cells of the pancreas to produce their pancreatic enzyme.\nAcinar cells: Mainly responsible for production of the inactive pancreatic enzymes (zymogens) that, once present in the small bowel, become activated and perform their major digestive functions by breaking down proteins, fat, and DNA/RNA. Acinar cells are stimulated by cholecystokinin (CCK), which is a hormone/neurotransmitter produced by the intestinal cells (I cells) in the duodenum. CCK stimulates production of the pancreatic zymogens.\nPancreatic juice, composed of the secretions of both ductal and acinar cells, contains the following digestive enzymes:\n\nTrypsinogen, which is an inactive(zymogenic) protease that, once activated in the duodenum into trypsin, breaks down proteins at the basic amino acids. Trypsinogen is activated via the duodenal enzyme enterokinase into its active form trypsin.\nChymotrypsinogen, which is an inactive (zymogenic) protease that, once activated by duodenal enterokinase, turns into chymotrypsin and breaks down proteins at their aromatic amino acids. Chymotrypsinogen can also be activated by trypsin.\nCarboxypeptidase, which is a protease that takes off the terminal amino acid group from a protein\nSeveral elastases that degrade the protein elastin and some other proteins\nPancreatic lipase that degrades triglycerides into two fatty acids and a monoglyceride\nSterol esterase\nPhospholipase\nSeveral nucleases that degrade nucleic acids, like DNAase and RNAase\nPancreatic amylase that breaks down starch and glycogen which are alpha-linked glucose polymers. Humans lack the cellulases to digest the carbohydrate cellulose which is a beta-linked glucose polymer.\nSome of the preceding endogenous enzymes have pharmaceutical counterparts (pancreatic enzymes) that are administered to people with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.\nThe pancreas's exocrine function owes part of its notable reliability to biofeedback mechanisms controlling secretion of the juice. The following significant pancreatic biofeedback mechanisms are essential to the maintenance of pancreatic juice balance/production:\n\nSecretin, a hormone produced by the duodenal \"S cells\" in response to the stomach chyme containing high hydrogen atom concentration (high acidicity), is released into the blood stream; upon return to the digestive tract, secretion decreases gastric emptying, increases secretion of the pancreatic ductal cells, as well as stimulating pancreatic acinar cells to release their zymogenic juice.\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a unique peptide released by the duodenal \"I cells\" in response to chyme containing high fat or protein content. Unlike secretin, which is an endocrine hormone, CCK actually works via stimulation of a neuronal circuit, the end-result of which is stimulation of the acinar cells to release their content. CCK also increases gallbladder contraction, resulting in bile squeezed into the cystic duct, common bile duct and eventually the duodenum. Bile of course helps absorption of the fat by emulsifying it, increasing its absorptive surface. Bile is made by the liver, but is stored in the gallbladder.\nGastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) is produced by the mucosal duodenal cells in response to chyme containing high amounts of carbohydrate, proteins, and fatty acids. Main function of GIP is to decrease gastric emptying.\nSomatostatin is a hormone produced by the mucosal cells of the duodenum and also the \"delta cells\" of the pancreas. Somatostatin has a major inhibitory effect, including on pancreatic  production.\n\nDuodenum\nThe following enzymes/hormones are produced in the duodenum:\n\nsecretin: This is an endocrine hormone produced by the duodenal \"S cells\" in response to the acidity of the gastric chyme.\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a unique peptide released by the duodenal \"I cells\" in response to chyme containing high fat or protein content. Unlike secretin, which is an endocrine hormone, CCK actually works via stimulation of a neuronal circuit, the end-result of which is stimulation of the acinar cells to release their content. CCK also increases gallbladder contraction, causing release of pre-stored bile into the cystic duct, and eventually into the common bile duct and via the ampulla of Vater into the second anatomic position of the duodenum. CCK also decreases the tone of the sphincter of Oddi, which is the sphincter that regulates flow through the ampulla of Vater. CCK also decreases gastric activity and decreases gastric emptying, thereby giving more time to the pancreatic juices to neutralize the acidity of the gastric chyme.\nGastric inhibitory peptide (GIP): This peptide decreases gastric motility and is produced by duodenal mucosal cells.\nmotilin: This substance increases gastro-intestinal motility via specialized receptors called \"motilin receptors\".\nsomatostatin: This hormone is produced by duodenal mucosa and also by the delta cells of the pancreas. Its main function is to inhibit a variety of secretory mechanisms.\nThroughout the lining of the small intestine there are numerous brush border enzymes whose function is to further break down the chyme released from the stomach into absorbable particles. These enzymes are absorbed whilst peristalsis occurs. Some of these enzymes include:\n\nVarious exopeptidases and endopeptidases including dipeptidase and aminopeptidases that convert peptones and polypeptides into amino acids.\nMaltase: converts maltose into glucose.\nLactase: This is a significant enzyme that converts lactose into glucose and galactose.  A majority of Middle-Eastern and Asian populations lack this enzyme.  This enzyme also decreases with age.  As such lactose intolerance is often a common abdominal complaint in the Middle-Eastern, Asian, and older populations, manifesting with bloating, abdominal pain, and osmotic diarrhea.\nSucrase: converts sucrose into glucose and fructose.\nOther disaccharidases\n\nPlants\nIn carnivorous plants, digestive enzymes and acids break down insects and in some plants small animals. In some plants, the leaf collapses on the prey to increase contact, others have a small vessel of digestive liquid. Then digestion fluids are used to digest the prey to get at the needed nitrates and phosphorus. The absorption of the needed nutrients are usually more efficient than in other plants. Digestive enzymes independently came about in carnivorous plants and animals.\nSome carnivorous plants like the Heliamphora do not use digestive enzymes, but use bacteria to break down the food. These plants do not have digestive juices, but use the rot of the prey.\nSome carnivorous plants digestive enzymes:\n\nHydrolytic  process\nEsterase a hydrolase enzyme\nProteases enzyme\nNucleases enzyme\nPhosphatases enzyme\nGlucanases enzyme\nPeroxidases enzyme\nUreas an organic compounds\nChitinase enzyme\n\nSee also\nErepsin\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "Digestive enzymes are classified by the substance they breakdown.

It stars Jessica Rothe and Israel Broussard. The film was produced by Jason Blum through his Blumhouse Productions banner. It follows college student Tree Gelbman, who is murdered on the night of her birthday but begins reliving the day repeatedly, at which point she sets out to find the killer and stop her death.\nHappy Death Day was released by Universal Pictures on October 13, 2017 and received generally mixed reviews. It grossed $125 million worldwide on a $4.8 million budget. A sequel, Happy Death Day 2U, was released on February 13, 2019.\n\nPlot\nAfter a night of drunken partying, Tree Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of classmate Carter Davis. She dismisses him, returning to her room. Her sorority housemate Lori Spengler gives her a cupcake, which she throws away. Tree meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask.\nShe immediately wakes up back in Carter's bed and is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she relives the day, this time avoiding the tunnel and reaching the party. However, the masked killer follows her and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter's bed, realizes she is in a time loop, and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, already hiding inside, murders her a third time.\nWaking up, Tree explains the events to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing suspects but is killed each time. After waking from a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. When the killer shows up, she escapes the hospital in Gregory's car, only to be pursued and killed again.\nBack in Carter's bed, Tree convinces him of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. She sees a news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, she rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Before delivering a fatal blow, she realizes that if she kills Tombs and ends the loop, Carter will remain dead forever. She runs to the top of the tower and hangs herself from the bell rope.\nTree awakens in Carter's dorm room and finds him alive again. Now confident in solving her murder, she proceeds happily through the day. She ends her affair with Dr. Butler and meets her father for lunch, where the two begin to reconcile. That night, she goes to the hospital and traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake Lori gave her.\nTree wakes up still in the loop. Horrified, she returns to her room with the intent to run away, when Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes that the previous loop was the only time she ate the cupcake, and she had died in her sleep, so Lori is her true killer. Lori had poisoned the cupcake, but when Tree failed to eat it, Lori used her job as a nurse at the hospital to frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Lori admits to also having an affair with Dr. Butler, whose preference for Tree drove Lori mad with jealousy. Tree stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth, then kicks her out of a second-story window to her death.\nAt a restaurant, Tree and Carter muse over the day's events, and he offers her his room for the night. The next day, Tree wakes up believing she is still in the time loop, but Carter quickly reveals he was just playing a prank on her and it is really the next day. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him, and the two kiss.\n\nCast\nProduction\nPre-production\nThe film, initially entitled Half to Death, is based on an original story created by screenwriter Scott Lobdell. It was first announced in June 2007, to be produced by Michael Bay and Rogue Pictures, and directed by Antti Jokinen. Christopher Landon was hired to rewrite Lobdell's original screenplay. Landon said, \"The movie was in pre-production or soft production at the time, and I came on and I loved the concept of the movie. I loved the idea of a girl, trapped in a time loop who has to solve her own murder.\" The project was only revived years later, as original producer Angela Mancuso had lunch with Landon and remembered Half to Death. Landon decided to send the script to Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions, with whom he had worked in the Paranormal Activity sequels, and he approved it, leading to a green-light by Universal Pictures. Blumhouse announced the project on October 11, 2016, with Landon directing and Jessica Rothe cast in the lead role of the film. On November 8, 2016, it was announced that Ruby Modine, Charles Aitken and Rachel Matthews had joined the cast, alongside Rothe and Israel Broussard. The film got eventually retitled Happy Death Day in June 2017.\nThe mask was constructed by Tony Gardner, the same man who built the \"Ghostface\" mask from every Scream film, and its design was personal. Landon explains, \"During preproduction ... I was expecting my first son. I don't know if I just had babies on the brain, or if I was subconsciously scared to become a father, but that baby image was floating around in my head. Tony made us a pig mask, too, but when I wore the baby mask in the office, I scared a co-worker, and we thought ... yeah, this is it. This is the one.\" Scream itself was listed among the influences Christopher Landon took for the film, along with Halloween (1978), Groundhog Day and comedies of the 1980s such as Sixteen Candles and Back to the Future, given he aimed to make a \"fun, silly horror movie\". He also aimed to emulate the protagonist's personal growth in Groundhog Day to comment on \"this age of social media and all the crappy things that kids do to each other\".\n\nWriting\nComic book writer Scott Lobdell said he wanted to play with the tropes of the slasher genre, as according to him \"every slasher film opens up with the mean girl getting killed and the good girl living till the end. And I thought, 'How can I make the mean girl and the good girl the same person?'\" In the original draft, Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers together. Landon says, \"They were a psycho couple murdering Tree together. That ultimately didn't work for me. I thought Gregory was a great opportunity to be a suspect. To make him a killer, it didn't help me. That was a change I really wanted to make.\" Also, in the original draft there was no birthday, and no romance, which Landon added to humanize Tree. Landon decided to shorten the protagonist's name Teresa into Tree, which also conveyed her character arc, as \"trees need to grow and you see this character go from one person to another\".\n\nFilming\nFilming took place at and around Loyola University in New Orleans, Louisiana, and it lasted 5 weeks. The scenes where Tree awakens in Carter's bed after her death were filmed back to back in a span of two days. The scene after Tree pushes Lori out of the window was supposed to be at the sorority house, but the filming permit was over before production was able to shoot there, forcing the location to be changed into a Los Angeles diner also featured in another Blumhouse production, Split.\n\nOriginal ending\nIn the film's original ending, Tree is taken to the hospital after her encounter with Lori. The doctor instructs Tree to stay away from pain medication for at least a day due to the extent of her injuries. After he leaves, a nurse comes in and says she is giving Tree something for the pain. Tree informs the nurse of the doctor's orders. The nurse reveals herself to be Dr. Butler's wife, Stephanie, who says it is for her own pain. She then murders Tree in revenge for her husband's affair with the girl.\nThis version was shown in the test screenings for the film and was received negatively by the audience, which led the writers to create the theatrical ending. Landon also revealed Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers in the rough drafts, which later inspired the idea of the poisoned cupcake.\n\nLegal issues\nThe film, which is set in New Orleans (and was filmed on the campus of Loyola University New Orleans), has the killer wearing a mask that is nearly identical to \"King Cake Baby\", the official mascot of the New Orleans Pelicans basketball team. Johnson Berticelli, the mascot's creator, sued Universal Pictures and Blumhouse for copyright infringement, demanding half of the film's profits. A settlement was reached in 2021.\n\nMusic\nBear McCreary composed the score of Happy Death Day. Reflecting the film's blend of horror and comedy, McCreary stated that he wanted \"a schizophrenic, dual personality, with light-hearted comedic scoring on one end, and genuinely terrifying soundscapes on the other.\" This approach is highlighted by the two main leitmotifs, an energetic theme for Tree evoking contemporary pop music, and one for the killer that consists of distorted vocals provided by McCreary's young daughter Sonatin. The percussion in the score are mostly sampled from college marching band drum lines to evoke the collegiate setting. While the film's trailer featured 50 Cent's \"In Da Club\" as Tree's ringtone, Landon said the film could not afford to use the track, but still preferred the eventual song music supervisor Andrea von Foerster improvised, the comedic \"Busy Day Birthday\".\n\nReception\nBox office\nHappy Death Day grossed $55.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $69.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $125.5 million, against a production budget of $4.8 million.\nIn the United States and Canada, Happy Death Day was released alongside Marshall, The Foreigner and Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, and was expected to gross $15\u201320 million from 3,130 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $1 million from Thursday night previews at 2,450 theaters, similar to fellow Blumhouse release The Visit ($1.05 million in 2015) and $11.6 million on its first day, increasing weekend projections to $26 million. It went on to debut to $26 million, topping the box office, making it the third Blumhouse Productions film of 2017 (after Split and Get Out) to do so. It fell 64% in its second weekend to $9.4 million, finishing in third behind newcomers Boo 2! A Madea Halloween and Geostorm.\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 71% of 162 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Happy Death Day puts a darkly humorous sci-fi spin on slasher conventions, with added edge courtesy of a starmaking performance from Jessica Rothe.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 58 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 52% of filmgoers rated it as \"definite recommend\".\nCritics noted that although the film makes laudable attempts at merging genres\u2014including romantic comedy, horror and \"campus satire\"\u2014the end results were mixed. Chris Agar of Screen Rant said that the \"fun, if silly, blending of genre tropes ... ends up being a double-edged sword.\" RelishMix\u2014a company that tracks social media engagement\u2014stated that audiences described it as \"Groundhog Day meets Scream\".\n\nHome media\nHappy Death Day was released on digital HD on January 2, 2018, and was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on January 16, 2018. Distributor Shout! Factory released both Happy Death Day and Happy Death Day 2U on 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray on May 31, 2022. The releases included a new commentary track with Landon and Rothe.\n\nOther media\nOn February 26, 2019, Blumhouse Books released a novelization written by Aaron Hartzler titled Happy Death Day & Happy Death Day 2U, to coincide with the second film's release.\n\nSequel\nDirector Christopher Landon talked about the possibility of a sequel, focusing on why Tree went into a time loop. Jessica Rothe stated that while most horror sequels retread the original, Landon's pitch instead \"elevates the movie from being a horror movie into a Back to the Future type of genre film where the sequel joins us right from where we left off, it explains a lot of things in the first one that didn't get explained, and it elevates everything.\"\nThe sequel was officially announced with filming scheduled to begin on May 10, 2018. Most of the original actors returned, including Rothe, Modine, Broussard, and Matthews. In addition, Suraj Sharma and Sarah Yarkin were cast. The sequel, titled Happy Death Day 2U, was released on February 13, 2019.\n\nSee also\nList of films featuring time loops\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHappy Death Day at IMDb"], "Ground_truth": "Theresa \"Tree\" Gelbman is the main character in the 2017 black comedy, Happy Death Day.

The imagery for the music video is inspired from the 1965 French New Wave film Pierrot le Fou. The music video starts at a party with Gomez, dressed in a vintage feather-trimmed green sequined high-neck dress, locking eyes with a sharply suited man (Andrey Kupchenko), and they steal a convertible and end up frolicking in a bucolic pasture. Gomez wears an ensemble fit for the French countryside: a vintage white skirt and a sleeveless orange-and-yellow crop top. and take Gomez's twist on iconic \u201960s French-girl style as some summer style inspiration.\nNevertheless, Gomez's video, is saturated with Godard's quintessential filmmaking quirks: fragmented editing; characters breaking the fourth wall; melodramatic dialogue; a garish, primary color-focused palette; and cartoonish neorealism. Cinemaphiles will immediately notice parallels, as the music video's opening visual directly mirrors the famous party scene in \"Pierrot le Fou,\" both doused in deep, ever-changing colors. The inane dialogue from side characters serves to highlight the shallow, bourgeois lifestyle that Pierrot wants to escape from. The two find they are wanted and burn their car to destroy the evidence. The video returns to the party from the start and despite everything, Gomez cycles back, locks eyes with the sharply dressed man and asks: \"Do you want to steal a car?\".\n\nAccolades\nTrack listing\nDigital download\n\"Back to You\" \u2013 3:30\nRiton and Kah-Lo remix\n\"Back to You\" (Riton and Kah-Lo remix) \u2013 3:27\nJoey Pecoraro remix\n\"Back to You\" (Joey Pecoraro remix) \u2013 3:46\nAnki Remix\n\"Back to You\" (Anki remix) \u2013 4:41\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits and personnel adapted from Rare album liner notes.\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nRelease history\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "The song Back to You made by Selena Gomez came out May 10, 2018, as the first single on the second season soundtrack of the television series, 13 Reasons Why.

The size of its catchment basin is 319,000 km2 (123,000 sq mi). Almost its entire length of approximately 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) is navigable during the summer months. As a result, it is an important transportation route in the regions through which it flows. The name Benue comes from Binuwe, meaning 'Mother of Waters\u2019 in the Batta language.\n\nGeography\nThe Benue rises in the Adamawa Plateau of northern Cameroon, from where it flows west, and through the town of Garoua and Lagdo Reservoir, into Nigeria south of the Mandara mountains, and through Jimeta, Ibi and Makurdi before meeting the Niger River at Lokoja.\nLarge tributaries are the Faro River, the Gongola River and the Mayo K\u00e9bbi, which connects it with the Logone River (part of the Lake Chad system) during floods. Other tributaries includeTaraba River and River Katsina Ala.\nAt the point of confluence, the Benue exceeds the Niger by volume. The mean discharge before 1960 was 3,477 cubic metres per second (122,800 cu ft/s) for the Benue and 2,863 cubic metres per second (101,100 cu ft/s) for the Niger. During the following decades, the runoff of both rivers decreased markedly due to irrigation.\n\nClimate\nBenue State has a tropical savanna climate. It is warm every month of the year throughout both wet and dry seasons. The annual temperature is 64\u00b0 degrees and there is about 244 inch of rain in a year. The state has an average humidity of 61%, dew point of  25 \u00b0C, an UV-index of 7 and it is mainly dry for 169 days in a year.\n\nMajor floods\nNigeria\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), conducted a \u201cdisaster risk management analysis\u201d and advised Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) to take proactive steps to mitigate the impact of climate change. The agency advised that water bodies across some states be desilted and dredged regularly to make water available for various purposes. The agency urged relevant institutions to carry out routine monitoring of dams and water bodies to ensure their operation rule curve for reservoirs is adhered to.\n\n2022 Flood\nOn September 23, 2022, flooding affected all riverine local government areas of Benue, according to the state Commissioner for Water Resources and Environment, Godwin Oyiwona. The flooding affected Makurdi, Agatu, Logo, Guma, Buruku, Otukpo, and Gwer-West. The government worked to mitigate flooding effects and released funds for cleaning the Idye Basin.\nIn October 2022, farmers in Adamawa State struggled to clear off remnants of crops destroyed by the flooding. The disaster disrupted many communities across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states, with hundreds of villages and urban centers submerged in water. The disaster unsettled over 2.4 million people and over 600 fatalities were recorded. Additionally, \"expansive hectares of farmlands across affected states were swept off.\"\nThe worst hit were mostly residents of agrarian communities near major tributaries in seven of the 21 local government areas in the state. Within three months, 12 Local Government Areas (LGAs) were submerged, affecting 82,730 residents, 13,788 households, 51 people injured, and 27 deaths. Farmlands worth billions of naira were destroyed.\n\nJanuary 2020\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated a 3.35-km drainage channel project in Makurdi, Benue, to address ecological challenges in the Idye Community. The project, part of the 17 ecological intervention projects, was approved by the President in the fourth quarter of 2017 and completed in 48 weeks. The project aimed to address the devastating effects of erosion and flood in the region.\n\n2017 Flood\nNews Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that Idye Community was among the worst-hit areas of the 2017 flood that displaced over 120,000 persons in the Benue capital, Makurdi. Floods devastated more than 200 households in Makurdi.\n\n2012 Flood\nThe Benue River flooded in October 2012, resulting in a large increase in the population of venomous snakes in the Duguri District, Alkaleri Local Government Area, Bauchi State. A July 2013 report indicated that over 200 people in the district had died of snakebite. The General Hospital in Kaltungo, Gombe State in Nigeria, is the nearest location for treatment of snakebite; \"whoever is lucky to make it to Kaltungo is treated in only two days and then they return home.\"\n\nPollution\nBenue Hike Tourism and Conservation Foundation, in an attempt to keep the river protected from various forms of pollution, informed the Benue State Government about the irregularities of some companies in the state for emptying waste in the river. Waste like ethanol, that could easily cause damage to human and aquatic life, was dumped into Benue River. Subsequently, the Benue State Government took an immediate attempt in addressing the issue to prevent further damages for its citizenry.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nChisholm, Hugh, ed.

Dwain Johnson at the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences and Chris Calkins at the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln were given grants to help mitigate these issues. Calkins and Johnson focused on the cheaper parts of beef, the chuck and the round, to see if a desirable steak could be produced from either of these. The research teams at both schools found that the top blade of the chuck, specifically the infraspinatus muscle, contained tender meat, but there was a large seam of tough connective tissue down the middle that had to be removed. Removing this tissue was seen to be too much effort for value for meat processors to bother with, as it wasn't felt that enough meat would be recovered to make it worth the while. Calkins and Johnson found that, while cutting out the tissue did result in a thin cut of beef, it plumped up well when cooked. The NCBA started promoting flat iron steak in 2001 and in the early 2000s Applebee's put it on the menu, and the Kroger grocery store chain started carrying the cut in 2006. In 2012, sales of flat iron steak brought in approximately $80 million USD.\n\nThe Cut\nThis cut of steak is from the shoulder of a beef animal. It is located adjacent to the heart of the shoulder clod, under the seven or paddle bone (shoulder blade or scapula). The steak encompasses the infraspinatus muscles of beef, and one may see this displayed in some butcher shops and meat markets as a top blade roast or informally called a \"patio steak\". Anatomically, the muscle forms the dorsal part of the rotator cuff of the steer. This cut is anatomically distinct from the shoulder tender, which lies directly below it and is the teres major. \nSteaks that are cross cut from this muscle are called top blade steaks, or chicken steaks. To make it more marketable, the cut which makes up this steak, which has the fascia dividing the infraspinatus within it, has increasingly been cut as two flatter steaks, with the tough fascia removed. This method of breaking down the larger cut was creation of the flat iron steak as we know it today. As a whole cut of meat, the top blade usually weighs around two to three pounds; it usually yields four steaks between eight and 12 ounces each. Flat iron steaks usually have a significant amount of marbling. In the North American Meat Processor (NAMP) meat buyers guide, it is item #1114D Beef Shoulder, Top Blade Steak.\n\nReferences\nExternal link\nChris R.

It starred Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson (who previously co-starred on That '70s Show) as brothers Colt and Rooster Bennett, respectively; who help run the Colorado cattle ranch owned by their father Beau (Sam Elliott). It also starred Debra Winger as their mother Maggie, a local bar owner, and Elisha Cuthbert as Colt's love interest Abby, a local schoolteacher. Other cast members from That 70s Show who had recurring roles included Wilmer Valderrama, Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp. It debuted in 2016 on Netflix and ran for four seasons in eight parts.\nEach season consists of 20 episodes broken up into two parts, each containing 10 episodes, which are approximately 30 minutes in length. All episodes are named after American country music songs.\n\nPremise\nThe show takes place on Iron River Ranch, near the fictitious small town of Garrison, Colorado (population 512, as displayed on a sign in the opening credits). Dialogue places the town in southwestern Colorado (near the real town of Ouray, Colorado), about a six hour drive from Denver. The series details the life of the Bennetts, a dysfunctional family consisting of brothers Colt and Rooster, their father Beau, and their mother Maggie who owns the local bar.\n\nCast\nMain\nAshton Kutcher as Colt Reagan Bennett, a former star quarterback for his high school football team who returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence to help his father and older brother on their family ranch while waiting for a tryout with a new semi-pro team in Denver. In the first episode, Colt reveals that he was the third-string quarterback for the Florida State team that won the National Championship in 1999. He pursued a professional career with little success, never finding regular playing time or stardom even on semi-pro teams, but hanging on in backup roles and on practice squads. Colt is frequently the butt of jokes, particularly when it comes to his lack of ranching skills, sub-par intelligence, and unsuccessful pro football career. He is a heavy drinker and has a habit of not using common sense, often acting before he thinks, but he is friendly and cares about other people deep down. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue, it's implied Colt has played for the Barcelona Dragons, San Jose SaberCats, Spokane Shock, Orlando Predators, Nebraska Danger, Sioux City Bandits, Iowa Barnstormers, Green Bay Blizzard, Minnesota Axemen, Portland Forest Dragons and Philadelphia Soul. Dialogue and team gear also indicate that he was a member of teams in Canada, notably the Ottawa Redblacks and fictional Saskatoon Cold (\"Like the Miami Heat... only cold\"). He has also played on teams in Alaska and was a member of the Buffalo Bills practice squad. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.\nDanny Masterson as Jameson \"Rooster\" Ford Bennett (seasons 1\u20133), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for accepting the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow, he is far more competent on the ranch and a more rational thinker. He has, however, been just as immature as Colt, drinking too much and slacking off. In the first half of part 5, Rooster gets into a rivalry with his ex-girlfriend Mary's intimidating boyfriend Nick, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.\nDebra Winger as Maggie Bennett, owner of Maggie's bar, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is at first separated and later divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Maggie is a free-thinker, an environmentalist, and an avid marijuana smoker. Much more patient and laid-back than Beau, Colt and Rooster often seek her company and advice on how to deal with problems, especially those concerning Beau.\nSam Elliott as Beau Roosevelt Bennett, Maggie's ex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A Vietnam War veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died. He is a curmudgeon, constantly annoyed with everyone and everything. He has a strained relationship with Rooster and Colt. He hates modern amenities and is easily angered by Colt and Rooster's antics. Beau appears to be a Republican with a soft-spot for Ronald Reagan but at times seems to despise all politicians regardless of affiliation.\nElisha Cuthbert as Abby Phillips-Bennett (seasons 2\u20134; recurring, season 1), a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school sweetheart. As the series begins, Abby has been in a five-year relationship with Kenny Ballard and briefly becomes engaged to him.

On December 9, 2019, it was reported that the second part of the final season (part 8) was set to be released on January 24, 2020.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nThe Ranch has earned mixed to positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the series an average approval rating of 63% (60% for season 1, 67% for season 2) based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A formulaic set-up and predictable plotting are elevated by The Ranch's surprising sensitivity and strong performances.\" Metacritic gave the series a score of 56 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nWriting for Slate in a positive review, television critic Willa Paskin wrote of the show, \"The Ranch is a red-state sitcom, though it takes place in the swing state of Colorado, and is good enough to be watched by people of any political affiliation\" and \"The goodness sneaks up on you.\" Los Angeles Times wrote: \"[Elliott and Winger's] scenes together, as restrained as they are, are the show's most emotionally resonant.

As a result of production delays, the remaining episodes began airing weekly nearly four months later, on July 30, 2017. The season comprised ten episodes but it originally was supposed to be fourteen episodes, and its initial airing concluded on October 1, 2017.\nThe premiere picks up where the second-season finale left off, as the show continues to follow the adventures of the members of the Smith household. When Jerry asks Beth to choose between him and Rick, the strength of their marriage is tested. Jerry is confronted with the loss of his family, while Beth begins to discover her independence again. Morty and Summer deal with their parents' separation by seeking more control over their lives. Rick's nihilistic way of life continues to prevent him from bonding with his family, as he remains unable to change his self-destructive behavior.\nThe third season of Rick and Morty delivered the highest ratings in Adult Swim's history and was the top-rated comedy among millennials on television. The season received largely positive reviews, with many critics highlighting its focus on character development.

Davis, Jonas Briedis, Phil Hendrie, Rob Paulsen, Alex Jayne Go, Jennifer Hale and Mariana Wise.\n\nEpisodes\nProduction\nRenewal and staff additions\nAdult Swim renewed Rick and Morty for a third season on August 12, 2015, shortly after a successful second-season premiere. Talking about the renewal, the two co-creators and executive producers expressed their delight at the series' popularity. Dan Harmon stated that it is \"an honor to see Rick and Morty join the exclusive club of shows with over nineteen episodes\", and Justin Roiland added \"I am blown away by the seemingly instant success of Rick and Morty. I look forward to continuing their adventures!\"\nIn an October 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Roiland revealed that the team had received a lot of scripts from female writers for the upcoming season, which had never happened before. He stated that \"We've gone from having zero spec scripts [in the running from female] candidates, to having five or six of them, so it's looking very likely that season three will have one, potentially two gals in the room.\" Eventually, four female writers were added to the staff, and\u2014counting out the co-creators of the show, Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon\u2014the writing room for the third season was gender-balanced.\nThe writing staff consisted of eleven writers, who collectively wrote and repeatedly rewrote each episode. Harmon noted that the writers' ideas were blended and refined during the writing process, and that the name of the writer that appeared in the opening credits of an episode is usually that of the person who had been assigned to prepare the episode's outline. Sarah Carbiener, one of the new female writers, said that she managed to learn many things from her experience as a member of the writing team. She explained that a story that for other shows would have been an entire episode, for Rick and Morty it will be only its first few minutes. Therefore, the team had to write a large amount of story in a very short time.\n\nSchedule delays and conclusion\nWriting began on November 2, 2015, and the first episode was recorded on February 18, 2016. In July 2016, already behind on schedule, the production team admitted that the success of the series had increased pressure to meet the expectations of the viewers. The creative freedom provided by Adult Swim entailed taking responsibility for product quality, and as the bar had risen higher, work had become harder, improvements were constantly being sought, and this often resulted in delays. Harmon told the assembled press at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con that \"it\u2019s not an endless perfectionism because you know when something finally clicks and you go 'this is a good episode of TV.'\" He added that the animators had to suffer the worst part of the schedule delays, as they were forced to work weekends in order to cope with the demanding workload.\n\nIn September 2016, the writing team had finished writing new episodes and they were waiting on their return from Bardel Entertainment, Rick and Morty's Canadian animation studio, for in-house screenings. After the animatics (video recorded versions of a hand-drawn storyboard with very limited motion) for each episode were made, and the production team was able to pre-visualize the animation, additional passes on the scripts would follow. In an interview with The Detroit Cast, writer Ryan Ridley revealed that the writing process for the third season was completed in November 2016, and noted that a season of Rick and Morty takes a long time to write and animate.\nIn February 2017, Harmon announced on his podcast, Harmontown, that the season was in the animation process, after a long period of writing. Around the same time, Bardel Entertainment's production supervisor  Mark Van Ee confirmed that \"everything is on track.\" In June 2017, when production of the season had been completed, Harmon wrote a series of posts on Twitter, where he refuted reports about his disagreements with Roiland being the main cause of the delay, and explained that the writing process took longer than expected to complete because of his perfectionism. Although it was revealed a few years later that Roiland's inability to focus on his writing duties along with creating distractions in the writer's room also led to various delays, causing a lot of tension between him and Harmon which forced the show to bring in a mediator to salvage their partnership.  As a result, the third season of Rick and Morty consisted of only ten episodes instead of fourteen, as was initially intended.\n\nRelease\nThe third season of Rick and Morty originally aired Sundays at 11:30 p.m EST. on Adult Swim, the adult-oriented nighttime programming block of Cartoon Network. The network offered free livestreams for the first two episodes of the season, with the remaining episodes requiring a cable subscription to watch the show live as it aired. Following the conclusion of the show's third season, Adult Swim made a livestream marathon of Rick and Morty available to watch on its official website in select regions, hoping to dissuade viewers from watching other illegal livestreams.\nThe episodes were made available to watch on Netflix in a number of countries outside the United States, one week after their original airdate. The season was added to Hulu on June 23, 2018, with the expansion following a similar timeline with that of the two previous seasons for the streaming service. Uncensored versions of the season are also available to purchase on various digital distribution platforms, including iTunes, Amazon and Microsoft Store. The digital release includes commentaries on every episode, and seven more short videos featuring co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland.\nThe season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 15, 2018, with special features including exclusive commentary and animatics for every episode, the origins of Rick and Morty, \"inside the episode\" material and an exclusive \"inside the recording booth\" session. Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage and showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss recorded audio commentary for the episode \"Pickle Rick\". Other guest commentaries include Marilyn Manson, Courtney Love, Russell Brand, and the winner of a crowdfunding campaign launched by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon to support Planned Parenthood. In his Blu-ray review for Forbes, Luke Y. Thompson describes the release as \"a thorough set that seems to have covered all the angles, and will provide hours of fun to even those fans who've watched every episode multiple times already.\"\n\nReception\nCritical response\nThe season has an approval rating of 96% from Rotten Tomatoes based on 175 reviews, and an average rating of 8.95 out of 10, with the site's consensus: \"Rick and Morty dives into new and even kookier cosmic dilemmas in a third season that interrogates familial bonds, love, and nihilism\u2014treating all existential topics to the series' trademark serrated wit.\"\nJesse Schedeen of IGN described the third season of the show as darker and more unpredictable than the first two, and praised its high-concept storytelling and character development. Schedeen gave the season an 8.8 out of 10 rating, saying that it \"didn't quite reach the heights of Season 2, but it is the series' most consistently entertaining and ambitious season yet\". Holding a similar position, Corey Plante of Inverse said that Rick and Morty managed to be both dark and funny in its third season.\nZack Handlen of The A.V. Club agreed that this was the darkest season of Rick and Morty, though he noted that the viewers have become desensitized to the show's violence. \"In previous seasons, the show managed a balance between self-mockery and honest joy in absurd scenarios. That joy is still there, more or less, but there\u2019s a bitterness to it that\u2019s harder and harder to ignore.\" Mike Cosimano of Comics Gaming Magazine did not think that the third season was dark; he said that it used \"cheap gut punches to elicit that very reaction\". He added that too many of the season's episodes were weak, since the show focuses on character development only in its first half, resulting in an uneven season. He considered the season to be a disappointment, rating it 6.5 out of 10.\nKayla Cobb of Decider focused on the dynamism displayed by Beth and Summer, as the characters broke the stereotypical conventions of the first two seasons. Cobb stated that \"Season 3 is the first time Rick and Morty really handed over the reigns [sic] to its leading ladies, and it was a horrifying delight.\" Julia Alexander of Polygon  highlighted the philosophical conflict between nihilist realism and life in ignorant bliss as the season's main theme, and noted that \"after an introspective season built on the importance of self-realization and reflection, Rick and Morty's third year ended on a total reset,\" with Beth and the kids reuniting with Jerry in the season-finale, as they seek comfort through escapism and ignore the realities of their lives. Zack Handlen considered Jerry's return to be an anticlimax and \"a necessary corrective to an arc that was in danger of going off the rails completely\". Handlen appeared skeptical about Beth's statement in the final episode, that from this point things will be like season one again, saying that \"the problem with going as far as season three went is that bridges stay burned.\"\n\nRatings\nRick and Morty completed its third season with overall viewership numbers increased by 81% over the previous season, and delivered the highest ratings in Adult Swim's history. Rick and Morty was the most popular television comedy within the 18\u201324 and 18\u201334 age ranges in the United States, based on \"Live+7\" ratings data spanning from December 2016 to September 2017. This rating system tracks live viewership plus streaming and on-demand viewing over an initial week-long period, and provides a more accurate picture of delayed viewing as compared to \"Live+Same Day\" ratings. Considering that episodes of the third season originally aired at 11:30 p.m. on Sundays, it is very likely that people would have watched them on-demand the next day or several days later.\nChristina Miller, the president of Adult Swim, told Fortune that Rick and Morty \"goes beyond just appealing to millennials,\" as numbers suggest that people of all ages are watching the show. The second episode of the season, which aired nearly four months after the unannounced premiere, was the season's most-watched episode with 2.86 million viewers, and the second-best on cable for the day it aired in adults 18\u201349, behind the weekly episode of Game of Thrones. The season finale was watched by 2.6 million live plus same day viewers and it was the most-watched telecast across all age groups.\n\nFanbase reactions\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, female writers Jane Becker, Sarah Carbiener and Jessica Gao addressed negative comments regarding their involvement in writing the third season of Rick and Morty, recalling a post on Reddit that called them \"the social justice warriors that Dan had to hire\". Gao stated: The people who say [hiring writers should be a meritocracy] have never ever thought about what that actually means and where that meritocracy comes from. Following the release of \"Pickle Rick\", one of the season's best-rated episodes, a number of fans participated in an online harassment campaign that targeted female writers of the show\u2014especially Jane Becker and Jessica Gao\u2014as they felt that they were \"ruining the show\" for them. Said writers received rape and death threats on Twitter, and had their personal information put online. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dan Harmon confronted the trolls, saying: I think it\u2019s all disgusting. These knobs, that want to protect the content they think they own\u2014and somehow combine that with their need to be proud of something they have, which is often only their race or gender.\n\nThe Szechuan sauce reference in the season premiere brought huge online attention for McDonald's discontinued promotional product. Internet memes spread rapidly on Reddit and Twitter, more than 40,000 people signed a petition at Change.org, asking for the return of the sauce, while an eBay auction resulted in a 20-year-old packet of this teriyaki sauce being sold for $14,700. On October 7, 2017, McDonald's served limited quantities of the sauce, without explicitly naming Rick and Morty as a reason for the return. Many fans waited for hours in long queues, but not all of them were served as the fast-food outlets ran out of the product. The fiasco prompted enraged reactions by disappointed fans, with some of them acting out and mistreating the company's workers.\n\nIn the wake of these events, the Rick and Morty fanbase received a bad reputation, with James Grebey of Inverse noting:  Rick and Morty is a good show, but it\u2019s quickly gaining a (frankly well-earned) reputation for having a really, really shitty fan base. Even series co-creator Dan Harmon hates a certain segment of his misogynistic fan base. Cameron Williams of Junkee attributed this \"toxic behavior\" to the rise of an aggressive type of entitled fan in the past decades, and examined the motivation of these people, noting: It\u2019s hard to feel special when you\u2019re a face in the crowd of millions of people. A lot of bad behaving fans look for an excuse to be oppressed so they can separate themselves from the mainstream. Emily Gaudette of Newsweek said that, with the spike in popularity, the show has obtained an army of online devotees, and commented on groups like the self-described \"Real Ricks\", who identify themselves with the series' main character and believe that high intellect is an excuse for mistreating others. Gaudette noted that these groups do not represent the Rick and Morty fanbase, but they \"tend to suck all the oxygen out of the virtual room.\" Series co-creator Justin Roiland said on his Twitter account that he sees more good than bad in the series' fanbase, and chooses to focus on that.\n\nAccolades\nRick and Morty received a total of eight nominations for its third season in 2017 and 2018, of which it won an IGN Award and a Critics' Choice Television Award, both in the categories for \"Best Animated Series\". Furthermore, the episode \"Pickle Rick\" received three nominations, of which it won an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Animated Program\" and an Annie Award for \"Best General Audience Animated Television/Broadcast Production\". With two nominations, \"The Ricklantis Mixup\" was another awarded episode of the season, that won its writers Ryan Ridley and Dan Guterman an Annie Award for \"Outstanding Achievement for Writing in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production\". Justin Roiland won an IGN Award for \"Best Comedic TV Performance\", while Christian Slater was nominated for a BTVA Voice Acting Award for his performance in \"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender\".\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nRick and Morty at IMDb"], "Ground_truth": "The third season of Rick and Morty, an American animated television series created by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, originally aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim.", "Answer": "Adult Swim", "Confidence": 0.95, "rouge_score": 0.12121212121212122}, {"Id": 0, "Original_question": "Who scored the first own goal in fifa world cup history?", "New_Question": "Who scored the first own goal in FIFA World Cup history?", "Documnet": ["This is a list of all own goals scored during FIFA Men's World Cup matches (not including qualification games).

Nicknamed \"Prime Time\", he played in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins, and Baltimore Ravens. Sanders was also a baseball outfielder for nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, and San Francisco Giants. He won two Super Bowl titles and made one World Series appearance in 1992, making him the only athlete to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series.\nSanders played college football for the Florida State Seminoles, where he won the Jim Thorpe Award as a senior. He was selected by the Falcons fifth overall in the 1989 NFL Draft and played football primarily at cornerback, while also making appearances as a return specialist and wide receiver. During his career, he was named to eight Pro Bowls, received six first-team All-Pros, and made consecutive Super Bowl appearances in Super Bowl XXIX with the 49ers and Super Bowl XXX with the Cowboys, winning both. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011.\nAfter retiring as a player, Sanders pursued a sports analyst and coaching career. He served as the head football coach for the Jackson State Tigers from 2020 to 2022, leading the team to two consecutive Celebration Bowl appearances and the first undefeated regular season in school history. Near the end of the 2022 season, Sanders was named the head football coach at Colorado.\n\nEarly life\nSanders was born on August 9, 1967, in Fort Myers, Florida, to Connie Sanders and Mims Sanders. His parents divorced when Sanders was two years old. Sanders was raised by his mother and her new husband, Willie Knight, whom Sanders credits with being influential in his life. He attended North Fort Myers High School, and was a letterman and All-State honoree in football, basketball and baseball. In 1985, Sanders was named to the Florida High School Association All-Century Team which selected the top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state.\nThe Kansas City Royals selected Sanders out of North Fort Myers High School in the sixth round of the 1985 Major League Baseball draft. However, he did not sign with the Royals.\n\nCollege career (1985\u20131989)\nSanders enrolled at Florida State University and played three sports for the Florida State Seminoles: football, baseball, and track. Beginning in his freshman year, he started in the Seminoles' secondary, played outfield for the baseball team that finished fifth in the nation, and helped lead the track and field team to a conference championship.\nUnder head coach Bobby Bowden, Sanders was a third-team All-American in 1986, and a two-time consensus All-American cornerback in 1987 and 1988,  intercepting 14 passes in his career, including three in bowl games, and managed to return one interception 100 yards for a touchdown, breaking Fred Biletnikoff's interception return record by one yard. He won the Jim Thorpe Award in 1988. He was also a standout punt returner for Florida State, leading the nation in 1988 with his punt return average, and breaking the school's record for career punt return yards. Sanders made an interception with five seconds left to seal Florida State's 13\u20137 win over Auburn in the 1989 Sugar Bowl during the 1988 postseason. Based on those accolades, his No. 2 jersey at Florida State was retired in 1995. He finished his career with 126 punt returns for 1,429 yards and three touchdowns, as well as 14 interceptions, returning them for 287 yards and three scores. At the time of his graduation, Sanders' 14 interceptions was the second highest total in school history. Bowden would later state that Sanders was his \"measuring stick for athletic ability\".\n\nWhile playing baseball under head coach Mike Martin at Florida State, Sanders' batting average was .331 in 1986. He also compiled 27 stolen bases in 1987.\nOn May 16, 1987 (while the Metro Conference baseball and track championships were being played simultaneously in Columbia, South Carolina), Sanders played in the conference semifinal baseball game against Southern Mississippi, ran a leg of a 4 \u00d7 100 relay, then returned to play in the baseball championship game against Cincinnati. Though Sanders' relay team did not place in the event, the FSU track team was the overall conference champion, and the baseball team won the conference title as well.\n\nProfessional baseball career (1989\u20131997, 2001)\nDrafts and minor leagues\nSanders had a nine-year, part-time baseball career, playing left and center field in 641 games with four teams. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the sixth round of the 1985 draft, but did not sign with them. The New York Yankees selected Sanders in the 30th round of the 1988 Major League Baseball draft, and he signed with the team on June 22. He batted .284 in 28 minor league games after signing.\nThe Yankees invited Sanders to spring training in 1989. Assigned to wear No. 71 as a uniform number, Sanders requested a single digit number. The Yankees gave him No. 30, the lowest number available, which offended many veteran players on the team. Sanders opened the 1989 season with the Albany-Colonie Yankees of the Double\u2013A Eastern League. Though Sanders planned to leave the Yankees in July to attend NFL training camp, he became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Falcons, and used the Yankees as leverage.\n\nNew York Yankees (1989\u20131990)\nSanders received a promotion to the major leagues, and spent the summer with the Columbus Clippers of the Triple\u2013A International League. Sanders made his MLB debut on May 31, 1989.\nDuring the 1989 season, Sanders hit a home run and scored a touchdown in the NFL in the same week, becoming the only player ever to do so. Sanders is also the only person to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series. Sanders and Bo Jackson were the preeminent multi-sport athletes of their time, but prior to the 1990 season, they had never squared off against each other in a professional game. That changed in 1990, when Jackson and Sanders met five times on the diamond\u2014the most memorable of which came on July 17, in what was billed as \"The Bo and Prime Time Show\". After Bo Jackson's three-homer night, Sanders said, \"He's (Bo's) one of the best athletes who ever put on a uniform.\"\nSanders made the Yankees' Opening Day roster for the 1990 season. On May 22, 1990, Sanders became involved in a dispute with Chicago White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk. Sanders started by stepping up to the plate with one out and a runner on third, drawing a dollar sign in the dirt before the pitch and then failed to run to first base after hitting a routine pop fly to shortstop, trotting back to the dugout instead. The Yankee fans booed, and Fisk told Sanders to run the ball out and called Sanders a \"piece of shit\". Later in the game, Sanders told Fisk that \"the days of slavery are over\". Fisk was furious, later saying: \"He comes up and wants to make it a racial issue, there's no racial issue involved. There is a right way and a wrong way to play this game.\"\nBy mid-July, Sanders expressed that he was unsure if he would remain with the Yankees or report to training camp for the upcoming NFL season. He requested a $1 million salary for the 1991 season, and the Yankees ended negotiations on a contract extension with Sanders. He left the team, finishing the 1990 season with a .158 batting average and three home runs in 57 games. In September 1990, the Yankees placed Sanders on waivers with the intention of giving him his release, as Yankees' general manager Gene Michael said that Sanders' football career was stunting his baseball development.\n\nAtlanta Braves (1991\u20131994)\nSanders later signed with the Atlanta Braves for the 1991 MLB season. On July 31, Sanders hit a key three-run homer to spark a comeback win against the Pittsburgh Pirates during the Braves' run to the National League West Division title. However, he had to leave the Braves the very next day to report to the Atlanta Falcons because of a clause in his NFL contract and missed the postseason. Before the 1992 season, Sanders reworked his NFL deal, whereby he still reported to the Falcons for training camp in August, but was allowed to rejoin the Braves for the postseason.\n\nDuring the 1992 season, his best year in the majors, Sanders hit .304 for the team, stole 26 bases, and led the NL with 14 triples in 97 games. In four games of the 1992 World Series, Sanders batted .533 with four runs, eight hits, two doubles, and one RBI while playing with a broken bone in his foot. His batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, total bases and win probability added each led the team in the series. Despite Sanders' performance, the Braves ultimately lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in six games. In Game 3, he narrowly avoided being a victim of what would have been only the second triple play in World Series history (following Bill Wambsganss' unassisted triple play in 1920). With Sanders on second base and Terry Pendleton on first, David Justice hit a deep fly ball to center field that Blue Jays center fielder Devon White unexpectedly caught with a leaping effort. Pendleton passed Sanders on the bases for the second out, but umpire Bob Davidson called Sanders safe after he scampered back to second base. Replays showed that Toronto third baseman Kelly Gruber tagged him on the heel before he returned to second.\n\nCincinnati Reds (1994\u20131995)\nThe Braves traded Sanders to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for Roberto Kelly on May 30, 1994. In 46 games played, Sanders batted .277 and stole 19 bases. The following year, he played in 33 games for the Reds, recording a .240 batting average with 16 stolen bases before being traded to the San Francisco Giants.\n\nSan Francisco Giants (1995)\nOn July 21, 1995, the Reds traded Sanders, Dave McCarty, Ricky Pickett, John Roper, and Scott Service to the San Francisco Giants for Dave Burba, Darren Lewis, and Mark Portugal. He batted .280, hit 5 home runs and stole 8 bases in 52 games for the Giants.\n\nCincinnati Reds (1997, 2001)\nIn 1997, Sanders finished second in the NL with 56 stolen bases in 115 games while with the Cincinnati Reds before leaving baseball for three years.\nSanders returned to the Reds in 2001, but was released after playing in only 32 games and batting just .173. After Sanders' release from the Reds, he signed a minor league contract with Toronto Blue Jays, who assigned him to the Triple-A Syracuse SkyChiefs.\nSanders' football contract had been negotiated to allow for him to play both baseball and football, but the terms of the contract stated that Sanders could miss NFL training camp and the first few games of the season only if he were playing Major League Baseball. Since he was not then on an MLB roster, Sanders had to leave Syracuse and return to the Washington Redskins so he would not violate his NFL contract.  In his final professional baseball game, Sanders hit a solo home run and an RBI single in Syracuse's 12\u20136 win over the Toledo Mud Hens. As those in MLB and the NFL urged Sanders to concentrate on only one sport (similar to what they did with Bo Jackson), he often explained, \"football is my wife and baseball is my mistress.\"\n\nProfessional football career (1989\u20132001, 2004\u20132005)\nDraft and Atlanta Falcons (1989\u20131993)\nAt the 1989 NFL Scouting Combine, Sanders ran a 4.27 and 4.29 second 40-yard dash. He was the fifth pick overall in the 1989 NFL draft by the Atlanta Falcons, where he played until 1993. Despite fumbling (and recovering) his first NFL punt return (which was re-kicked on a penalty), Sanders ran for a touchdown on his second attempt of his first game. During his time in Atlanta, he intercepted 24 passes (including a career-high seven in 1993), three of which he returned for touchdowns. In 1992, he also led the league in kickoff return yards (1,067), yards per return (26.7) and return touchdowns (two). On October 11, 1992, Sanders played in a Falcons game in Miami and then flew to Pittsburgh, hoping to play in the Braves' League Championship Series game against the Pirates that evening and become the first athlete to play in two professional leagues in the same day. Sanders, however did not appear in the baseball game that night. During his five years playing with the Falcons, Sanders scored 10 touchdowns (three defensive, three kick returns, two punt returns, and two receptions).\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (1994)\nAfter five seasons with Atlanta, Sanders signed on to play the 1994 season with the San Francisco 49ers. He had arguably his best season as a professional football player, recording six interceptions and returning them for an NFL-best 303 yards and three touchdowns, averaging 50.5 yards per return. (Average yards-per-interception return is not an official NFL statistic however.) It was also the most interception-return-yardage in a single-season since Charlie McNeil in 1961. Two of his interceptions were returned for a gain of at least 90 yards, making him the first player to do this in NFL history. On October 16, 1994, Sanders made his dramatic return to the Georgia Dome in a 49er uniform. After getting into a scuffle with his former Falcon teammate Andre Rison, Sanders intercepted a pass from quarterback Jeff George and returned it 93 yards while mockingly staring down the entire Falcons sideline before high-stepping into the end zone. Sanders was later voted the 1994 NFL Defensive Player of the Year. In Super Bowl XXIX, he recorded an end zone interception in the fourth quarter as the 49ers won over the San Diego Chargers, earning him his first championship ring.\n\nDallas Cowboys (1995\u20132000)\nSanders, along with his agent Eugene Parker, courted several teams in need of a cornerback. The teams in the \"Deion Sweepstakes\", as it was called by the media, were the Philadelphia Eagles, Oakland Raiders, Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys, who had lost their starting cornerback Kevin Smith to injury for the rest of the season.\nOn September 9, 1995, (in Week 2 of the season), Sanders signed a lucrative contract with the Dallas Cowboys (seven years, $35 million with a $12.999 million signing bonus, because owner Jerry Jones was superstitious about the number 13), essentially making him at the time, the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL. Sanders later stated in his book Power, Money & Sex: How Success Almost Ruined My Life that the Oakland Raiders offered him more money than any other team, but he chose to play in Dallas for more time on the offensive side of the ball, a chance to win back-to-back Super Bowls, and because of his friendship with Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin. Arthroscopic surgery kept him sidelined until his debut in Week 9, which was once again in Atlanta against the Falcons; the Cowboys won, 28\u201313. He went on to help the Cowboys win their third title in four years in Super Bowl XXX against the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he returned a punt for 11 yards and caught a 47-yard reception on offense, setting up Dallas's first touchdown of the game and a 27\u201317 victory. Sanders played four more seasons with Dallas, earning Pro Bowl selection in all of them. On June 2, 2000, he was released in a salary-cap move.\n\nWashington Redskins (2001)\nSoon after the Cowboys released Sanders, the Washington Redskins signed Sanders to a seven-year, $56 million contract. At the end of the 2000 season and an above-average statistical year, Sanders abruptly retired in July 2001 after only playing one year with the Redskins.\nOn December 23, 2002, the Redskins waived Sanders from the reserve/retired list in order to potentially allow him to play for the Oakland Raiders in the 2002\u201303 NFL playoffs. If he had passed through waivers unclaimed, he would have been able to sign a free-agent contract with any team and play during the season. However, on December 25, five teams (the Indianapolis Colts, Kansas City Chiefs, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Diego Chargers and Tennessee Titans) placed waiver bids for him, with the Chargers claiming him by having the highest waiver priority. Since it was too late in the season to be activated from the reserve/retired list, he was unable to play for the Chargers for the rest of the season.\n\nBaltimore Ravens (2004\u20132005)\nIn 2004, Sanders announced his intention to come out of retirement after being convinced by his friend Joe Zorovich, Baltimore Ravens cornerback Corey Fuller, and linebacker Ray Lewis to play. He signed a one-year deal with the Ravens to be a nickelback. Sanders chose to wear the number 37, which matched his age at the time, to preemptively let people know that he was well aware of his relative senior status as an NFL player (additionally, his usual number 21 was already being worn by Ravens Pro Bowl cornerback Chris McAlister). Against the Buffalo Bills in Week 7 of 2004, Sanders scored his ninth career interception return touchdown, moving him into a tie with Ken Houston and Aeneas Williams, and behind Rod Woodson (with 12), for second place all-time in the statistical category.\nSanders played in every game of the 2005 season. The Ravens failed to qualify for the postseason for the second straight year and he retired in January 2006.\n\nNFL career statistics\nDefensive/Special team statistics\nOffensive statistics\nCoaching career\nHigh school\nWhile continuing to work as an NFL analyst, Sanders became the head coach for the Prime Prep Academy, which he co-founded. The executive director of the school twice tried to fire Sanders, in one instance after witnesses said Sanders grabbed a school official by the collar, causing the official to fall to the floor. He stayed as the head coach for 2012 and 2013. The school was shut down in 2015 amid a spate of problems.\nIn 2015, he was hired as the head coach for Triple A Academy, where he was the coach for two seasons.\nIn 2017, he became the offensive coordinator for Trinity Christian High School giving him the opportunity to coach his sons Shilo and Shedeur Sanders, along with his eldest son Deion Jr.\n\nJackson State\n2020 season\nOn September 21, 2020, Deion Sanders became the 21st head coach of the Jackson State Tigers of the historically black (HBCU) Jackson State University. The Tigers play in the second level of NCAA football, the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). In his first season in spring 2021, abbreviated and delayed from its normally intended fall 2020 schedule due to COVID-19 disruptions, he led the Tigers to a 4\u20133 record, with one win by forfeit.\n\n2021 season\nIn the fall 2021 season, Sanders led the Tigers to the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) title and a program record of 11 wins, also being named the recipient of the fall 2021 Eddie Robinson Award as the season's top FCS head coach. Jackson State went on to play in the 2021 Celebration Bowl where they were defeated by South Carolina State 31\u201310.  The following season, Jackson State again played in the Celebration Bowl where they were again defeated 41\u201334 by North Carolina Central, bringing Coach Sanders' overall bowl record to 0\u20132.\n\n2022 season\nSanders notably flipped the recruitment of defensive back Travis Hunter who was the number one overall recruit in the 2022 class. Hunter initially committed to Sanders' alma mater Florida State. The move was heralded by recruiting director Steve Wiltfong; he said it was \"the biggest signing day moment in the history of college football\" as Football Championship Subdivision programs and the HBCUs that compete at such a level of competition are not usual destinations for high level recruits out of high school. Hunter was the first five-star recruit to sign with an FCS program. Not only did Sanders attract high-level recruits for HBCUs, he increased revenue for these once low funded teams and put HBCUs on the map.  Sanders paid for meals and training facilities out of his own pocket.\nSanders led Jackson State to a 27\u22126 record during his three seasons at the helm.\n\nColorado\n2023 season\nOn December 3, 2022, Sanders was named the head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes. Sanders made extensive use of the transfer portal in replacing nearly the Buffaloes' entire roster, with 46 players leaving in the transfer portal and 50 transferring in. Nine followed him from Jackson State, including sons Shedeur and Shilo, and former five-star recruit Hunter. After going 1\u201311 in the previous season, Colorado won their first three games of the 2023 season, then lost their next two, then recorded their only conference win of the season. Colorado finished the season 4\u20138 with a 1\u20138 record in Pac-12 play.\n\nHead coaching record\nCollege\nHigh school\nLegacy and honors\nDuring his 14-year NFL career, Sanders was a perennial All-Pro and considered by many as one of, if not the strongest pass defenders ever to play the game.\nSanders also occasionally lined up with the team's offense. During the 1996 season, Sanders skipped the baseball season, concentrating on football, and attended the first NFL training camp of his career to better familiarize himself with the nuances of the wide receiver position. He became only the second two-way starter (after the Cardinals' Roy Green) in the NFL since Chuck Bednarik.\nSanders is the only man to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series, to hit an MLB home run and score an NFL touchdown in the same week, and to have both a reception and an interception in the Super Bowl. He is one of seven players to win back-to-back Super Bowls with different teams. He is also one of two players to score an NFL touchdown six different ways (interception return, punt return, kickoff return, receiving, rushing, and fumble recovery).\nDuring his career, Sanders intercepted 53 passes for 1,331 yards (a 25.1 yards per return average), recovered four fumbles for 15 yards, returned 155 kickoffs for 3,523 yards, gained 2,199 yards on 212 punt returns, and caught 60 passes for 784 yards. Sanders amassed 7,838 all-purpose yards and scored 22 touchdowns, nine interception returns, six punt returns, three kickoff returns, three receiving, and one fumble recovery. His 19 defensive and return touchdowns was an NFL record (now held by Devin Hester with 20 return touchdowns). In the postseason Sanders added five more interceptions, as well as three receptions for 95 yards, four carries for 39 yards, and two touchdowns (one rushing and one receiving). He was selected to eight Pro Bowls and won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1994.\n\nCollege Football News named Sanders No. 8 in its list of 100 Greatest College Football Players of All-Time.\nThe Sporting News named Sanders No. 37 in their Top 100 Football Players of the Century released in 1999.\nESPN named Sanders No. 74 in its list of the 100 Great Athletes of the Century released in 1999.\nNFL.com named Sanders No. 34 on NFL's Top 100 list released in late 2010\nNFL Network named \"Deion Sanders and anyone\" in their Top 10 greatest cornerback tandems in NFL history: \"...Deion Sanders started opposite 13 other cornerbacks, and no matter who started on the other side the defense was better with No. 21 baiting QBs.\"\nOn November 11, 2010, Sanders was inducted into the Atlanta Falcons' Ring of Honor.\nOn May 17, 2011, Sanders was announced as a College Football Hall of Fame inductee.\nOn August 6, 2011, Sanders was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\nOn February 6, 2011, at Super Bowl XLV in Arlington, Texas, Sanders performed the pre-game coin toss.\nSanders did not attend classes or take final exams during the fall semester (1988) of his senior year at Florida State, yet played in the Sugar Bowl against Auburn. This caused the state legislature to create the \"Deion Sanders rule\", whereby a football athlete at any state university could not play in a bowl game if he failed to successfully complete the previous semester.\nIn 1995, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL's salary cap. This caused the NFL to institute its own \"Deion Sanders rule\", whereby a prorated portion of a player's signing bonus counted against the salary cap.\n\nMedia appearances and pop culture fame\nSanders became known for sporting a \"do-rag\" or bandana and for high-stepping into the end zone followed by his touchdown dance celebrations. \nAt the end of his Hall of Fame speech, he put a bandana on his bust.\nHis \"Prime Time\" nickname was given to him by a friend and high-school teammate, Florida Gators defensive back Richard Fain. The two played pickup basketball games together during the prime time television hour, and Sanders' athletic display during those games earned him the nickname. His other nicknames are \"Lil Nicky\" (for comparing himself with NCAA coaching great Nick Saban) and \"Neon Deion\".\nSanders, wearing custom-made showy suits and flashy jewelry, capitalized on his image. On December 26, 1994, Sanders released Prime Time, a rap album on MC Hammer's Bust It Records that featured the singles \"Must Be the Money\" and \"Prime Time Keeps on Tickin'\". The album and singles didn't chart in the Top 40. Following his first Super Bowl victory with the San Francisco 49ers, Sanders hosted Saturday Night Live, broadcast on February 18, 1995. Sanders performed a medley of songs from Prime Time, including \"Must Be the Money\" and \"Heidi Heidi Hey\".\nAs Hammer's friend, Sanders appeared in the \"2 Legit 2 Quit\" music video, and his alter-ego \"Prime Time\" showed up in Hammer's \"Pumps and a Bump\" music video. Hammer, being a big sports fan, launched a new enterprise called Roll Wit It Entertainment & Sports Management which boasted such clients as Evander Holyfield, Deion Sanders and Reggie Brooks. In 1995, Hammer released \"Straight to My Feet\" with Sanders, from the Street Fighter soundtrack (released in December 1994). The song charted No. 57 in the UK.\nIn January 1995, Sanders became the spokesman for the Sega Sports line of video games. Sanders has also appeared in television commercials for such companies as Nike, Pepsi, Burger King, Pizza Hut and American Express. These included a Road Runner Pepsi ad, with Sanders as the Road Runner with Wile E. Coyote targeting him, and a Pizza Hut commercial in which he appeared with Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. He also makes a cameo as himself in the film Celtic Pride.\nAfter retiring from the NFL in 2001, Sanders worked as a pre-game commentator for CBS' The NFL Today until 2004, when contract negotiations failed. Sanders turned down a 30% salary increase demanding to be paid $2.5 million, the highest of any NFL TV analyst. He was replaced by Shannon Sharpe. During Sanders' run, he participated in several sketches. The first was \"Primetime and 21st\", a mock street corner where Sanders (not yet a regular panelist) would give his opinions. Another one was his \"Sanders Claus\" persona, one of numerous sketches that involved young kids in football jerseys, representing NFL players, receiving a sarcastic gift from Sanders. Sanders actually debuted as \"Sanders Claus\" in a set of Nike commercials.\n\nSanders frequently made guest appearances on ESPN, especially on the ESPN Radio Dallas affiliate, and briefly hosted a show called The New American Sportsman. He also hosted the 2002 Miss USA pageant.\nSanders co-hosted the 2004 GMA Dove Awards broadcast, taped in late April 2004, and slated for air on UPN in May 2004. When negotiations with fellow Viacom property The NFL Today failed two weeks before the broadcast, and he signed a deal with ESPN, UPN promptly canceled the broadcast, and the show aired on the i Network in December 2004 (both UPN and CBS are owned by CBS Corporation).\nSanders works at NFL Network as an analyst on a number of the network's shows. Prior to the Sunday night game, Sanders, alongside host Rich Eisen and Steve Mariucci, breaks down all the action from the afternoon games on NFL GameDay. At the conclusion of all the action on Sunday, Sanders, Mariucci, Michael Irvin and host Fran Charles recap the day's action with highlights, analysis and postgame interviews. For the 2010 season, Sanders joined Eisen, Mariucci and Marshall Faulk on the road for Thursday Night Kickoff presented by Lexus, NFL Network's two-hour pregame show leading into Thursday Night Football. The group broadcasts live from the stadium two hours prior to all eight live Thursday Night Football games and returns for the Sprint halftime show and Kay Jewelers postgame show. Sanders also has a segment called \"Let's Go Primetime\" on NFL Network.\nIn 2008, Sanders and his wife starred in the reality show Deion & Pilar: Prime Time Love, centering on them and their five children living in the small town of Prosper, Texas. That same year, he appeared with his family on Celebrity Family Feud in the July 22, 2008, episode, competing against Caitlyn and Kris Jenner, Kim, Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\nSanders appeared as himself in the fourth season of The League, playing a prospective buyer of Andre's apartment.\nIn 2014, Sanders was featured in an episode of Running Wild with Bear Grylls, where he and Grylls hiked in the desert of southern Utah for two days, rappelling down canyon walls and later climbing up a mesa.\nSanders served as an alumni captain for Team Sanders in the 2014 Pro Bowl. He also re-joined CBS Sports as a studio analyst for Thursday games only. He still works for the NFL Network on Sundays.\nIn 2015, he competed against singer Justin Bieber in an episode of Spike's Lip Sync Battle and won with performances of \"Play That Funky Music\" by Wild Cherry and \"Like a Virgin\" by Madonna.\nSanders and his girlfriend Tracey Edmonds were featured together on an episode of Tiny House Nation that first aired on January 21, 2017.\nIn 2018, Sanders appeared in disguise on Undercover Boss; he met with youth coaches and the less fortunate; it aired on CBS.\nSanders is featured in the docuseries Coach Prime, which follows his career as a college football head coach.\n\nLeon Sandcastle\nLeon Sandcastle is a fictional character, depicted as a disguise for Sanders. The Sandcastle character was created for an NFL Network commercial. Sandcastle first appeared in a Super Bowl commercial in 2013. The commercial depicted Sanders suggesting he could still play at a level higher than the rookies in the 2013 NFL draft and deciding to make a comeback. He dons an afro, assumes the impromptu alias \"Leon Sandcastle\" and enters the draft, going through the full NFL Scouting Combine. For action shots, Ball State cornerback Andre Dawson served as the stunt double. The commercial features Sandcastle being drafted 1st overall in the draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. A voiceover then instructs viewers to watch NFL Network for offseason and draft coverage at the end noting in a deadpan voice that \"the next rookie sensation probably won't be Leon Sandcastle.\"\nDespite not being an actual prospect for the 2013 NFL Draft, several combine videos have been created. The most prominent of these videos is Sandcastle's \"4.2 40 yard dash\". The NFL also created a \"Combine Profile\" for Sandcastle, as they do with actual prospects. In Rich Eisen's 2013 annual 'Run Rich Run' event, Sandcastle appeared giving tips to Eisen. Sandcastle's combine profile reveals that Sandcastle attended Primetime University. The commercial had a positive social media response as \"Leon Sandcastle\" was trending on Twitter worldwide, shortly after the commercial's airing. Sandcastle was also put into Madden NFL 13 as a card in the 'Ultimate Team' game mode. For April Fools' Day, 2013, NFL.com reported that Sandcastle would be the Chiefs' first overall selection.\nThe character developed marketing value and continued to appear in headlines, such as a fake endorsement deal with Under Armour and continued to make other appearance at NFL events. Sandcastle also had football trading cards produced and inserted into products by Topps and Panini America.\n\nOther business and entertainment ventures\nIn addition to his sports career, Sanders also had a career in music as a rapper. He released his debut album in 1994, Prime Time, through Hammer's Bust It Records label via Capitol Records. In 1995, Hammer released \"Straight to My Feet\" with Sanders, from the Street Fighter soundtrack (released in December 1994). The song charted No. 57 in the UK.\nSanders moved on to other ventures after his retirement. In 2003, Sanders took interest in Devin Hester, a return specialist from Miami. Sanders mentored Hester; he counselled and advised him during his collegiate career. The Chicago Bears drafted Hester in the second round of the 2006 NFL draft. Since then, Hester has broken the record for the most total returns for touchdowns in NFL history with 14 punt returns, 5 kick off returns, and 1 missed field goal return (20). Hester has cited Sanders as one of his major inspirations and idols, and thanked him for his training and advice. Hester, also known as \"Anytime\", on occasion performed Sanders' signature touchdown dance and high-steps in homage to his mentor.\nSanders also tried to adopt a high school running back, Noel Devine, who was one of the top recruits in 2007. Sanders was advised against doing this but responded, \"He doesn't have parents; they died. God put this young man in my heart. This is not about sports. This is about a kid's life.\" He now mentors Devine, and was a factor in Devine's extended wait to sign a letter-of-intent to West Virginia University. Devine eventually signed to play football for the Mountaineers.\nSanders has also been a mentor to Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Michael Crabtree, as well as former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, Dez Bryant.\nIn January 2004, Sanders was hired as an assistant coach to the Dallas Fury, a women's professional basketball team in the National Women's Basketball League, even though Sanders had never played organized basketball either in college or the professional level.\nOn September 2, 2005, in response to Hurricane Katrina, Sanders challenged all professional athletes in the four major sports to donate $1,000 each to relief efforts, hoping to raise between $1.5 and $3 million. Sanders said \"Through unity, we can touch thousands... I have friends and relatives that feel this pain. Help in any way you can.\" In April 2006, Sanders became an owner of the Austin Wranglers, an Arena Football League team.\nSanders has occasionally served as a celebrity spokesperson, such as representing Monitronics, a security system firm, at an industry conference in the spring of 2010.\nOn April 10, 2024, Sanders entered into an endorsement deal with Boost Mobile.\n\nDiscography\nPersonal life\nSanders has been married twice: to Carolyn Chambers (1989\u20131998), with whom he has two children; and Pilar Biggers-Sanders (1999\u20132015), with whom he has three children.\nIn 1997, Sanders was going through a dark time in his life when his first marriage was ending and said he attempted suicide by driving a car off a cliff in Cincinnati while playing for the Reds. He has said he was driving as fast as 70 m.p.h. when he drove his car off a 30-to-40-foot (about 9-to-12-meter) cliff but that \"there wasn't a scratch on me or on the car.\"\nSanders, a Christian, said, \"I finally just got on my knees and gave it all to the Lord.\" He has also said that money, sex, and other things did not solve his problems.\nSanders, along with J. M. Black, published his autobiography, Power, Money & Sex: How Success Almost Ruined My Life (Word Publishing, 1998). The book was inspired after he began counseling with Bishop T. D. Jakes. He names his agent, Eugene Parker, as another person who has influenced his life.\nIn April 2012, a dispute between Sanders and his estranged wife, Pilar Sanders, led to Pilar and Deion both facing misdemeanor assault charges, but a judge later ruled that neither party had committed family violence in that instance. The former couple had a bitter custody dispute in 2013 over their three children, and a Texas jury voted to give Deion Sanders sole custody of their two sons and joint custody over their daughter. Pilar criticized the decision, saying that the judge had not allowed testimony about the 2012 dispute.\nIn 2012, Sanders co-founded the charter school Prime Prep Academy. Sanders was later fired as the coach after CFO Kevin Johnson alleged Sanders assaulted him. Sanders publicly denied the claim, but witnesses said he had grabbed the school official by the collar, causing him to fall. Sanders pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge and paid a $765.70 fine. Prime Prep Academy was criticized for a lack of focus on academics and poor management, and it shut down in 2015. The school had amassed debt, owing payments to the I.R.S. and a teachers' retirement fund, and, when it shut down, it did not have enough money to meet payroll.\nIn 2015, Sanders was named the CEO of FOCUS Academies and granted the head coaching position at Triple A Academy, which Sanders led to face his alma mater North Fort Myers High School in Florida, a game featuring a key matchup between several ranked recruits. On August 17, 2017, it was announced by CBS Sports that Sanders would be switching coaching positions at a new high school to become the offensive coordinator at Trinity Christian-Cedar Hill high school in Cedar Hill, Texas. The move was significant for Sanders, as both his sons played at the high school. Sanders served on the staff as offensive coordinator under former Dallas Cowboy Aveion Cason.\nSanders' son Shilo played defensive back for South Carolina for two seasons before transferring to Jackson State University in December 2020. A younger son, Shedeur, is a quarterback who was verbally committed to Florida Atlantic, but flipped his commitment to Jackson State. He enrolled at Jackson State in January 2021, redshirting the rescheduled spring 2021 season before winning the starting job that summer. After leading his father's team to its first SWAC title since 2007 in the fall 2021 season, Shedeur was named that season's recipient of the Jerry Rice Award as the top FCS freshman. Shedeur then followed his father and transferred to Colorado. He was immediately named the Buffaloes' starting quarterback. After graduating from Jackson State in 2023, Shilo transferred to Colorado to join his father and brother.\nIn 2020, Sanders graduated from Talladega College with a bachelor's degree in business administration with an emphasis on organizational management.\nIn 2021, Sanders underwent several foot surgeries and had two toes on his left foot amputated as a result of blood clots. In 2023, Sanders again underwent a similar surgery onto his left leg, with amputation as a potential outcome.\n\nSee also\nList of Major League Baseball annual triples leaders\nList of athletes who came out of retirement\nList of athletes who played in Major League Baseball and the National Football League\n\nNotes and references\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nColorado profile\nJackson State profile\nRising Star: A Filipino-Salvadoran Quarterback Leads the Charge for a Top US High School Football Team\nDeion Sanders at the College Football Hall of Fame\nDeion Sanders on X (social network)\nDeion Sanders on Instagram\nCareer statistics and player information from NFL.com \u00b7 Pro Football Reference\nCareer statistics and player information from Baseball Reference, or Baseball Reference (Minors)\nDeion Sanders at IMDb"], "Ground_truth": "Deion Sanders, a former professional football and baseball player, played college baseball for four years at Florida State University from 1986-1989.

The huge expanse of Texas encompasses several regions with distinctly different climates: Northern Plains, Trans-Pecos Region, Texas Hill Country, Piney Woods, and South Texas.  Generally speaking, the part of Texas that lies to the east of Interstate 35 is subtropical, while the portion that lies to the west of Interstate 35 is arid desert.\nTexas ranks first in tornado occurrence with an average of 139 per year. Tropical cyclones can affect the state, either from the Gulf of Mexico or from an overland trajectory originating in the eastern Pacific Ocean.  Those originating from the Gulf of Mexico are more likely to strike the upper Texas coast than elsewhere. Significant floods have occurred across the state throughout history, both from tropical cyclones and from stalled weather fronts.\n\nCharacteristics by region\nNorthern area\nThe Northern Plains' climate is semi-arid and is prone to drought, annually receiving between 16 and 32 inches (410 and 810 mm) of precipitation, and average annual snowfall ranging between 15 and 30 inches (380 and 760 mm), with the greatest snowfall amounts occurring in the Texas panhandle and areas near the border with New Mexico.  During the summer, this area of state sees the most clear days.  Winter nights commonly see temperatures fall below the freezing mark, or 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C).  The wettest months of the year are April and May.  Tornadoes, caused by the convergence of westerly and southerly prevailing winds during the late spring, are common, making the region part of Tornado Alley. Poor land management, drought, and high wind speeds can cause large dust storms, minimized in modern times by improved land-management practices, but most troublesome in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl period.  The panhandle region, farthest from the Gulf of Mexico, experiences colder winters than the other regions of Texas, where occasional wintertime Arctic blasts can cause temperatures to plunge to well below freezing and bring snowy conditions.\nInternational areas with comparable climate: Southern China; North Argentina; New South Wales, Australia.\n\nTrans Pecos Region\nThe Trans-Pecos region, also known as Big Bend Country, is in the west-central and western parts of the state, consisting of the Chihuahuan Desert and isolated mountain ranges.  During fall, winter, and spring, it experiences the most clear days statewide.  It is also the driest receiving an average annual rainfall of only 16 inches (410 mm) or less.  Snowfall is rare at lower elevations, although the highest mountain peaks are prone to heavy snowfalls during winter.  The arid climate is the main reason for desertification of the land, but overgrazing is slowly widening the land area of that desert.  In the mountain areas one can see coniferous forests in a wetter and more temperate environment.  The wettest months in this region occur during the summer.  Winds are strengthened as they are forced to push through canyons and valleys. In the flatter areas these winds are harvested into usable electricity.\n\nInternational areas with comparable climate: Iraq; Iran; Sahel region in Africa\n\nHill Country\nThe Texas Hill Country, or central Texas is shaped by its many rivers and hills. The climate is semi-arid west of Brady through Junction to Rocksprings, but it is sub-humid east and south of that area; both areas have hot summers and mild winters with occasional cold spells. Humidity is high during the warm season, though afternoons especially further northwest can see a wind shift and drier air before Gulf air returns after sunset. The vegetation is both broadleaf evergreen and deciduous in the river valleys, and coniferous where there is greater elevation. Dry savannas, open woodlands, and shorter grasses dominate the northwest, while closed woodlands and moist savannas mix with taller grasses in the east and south. In a single year the region can receive up to 48 inches (1,200 mm) of precipitation, and flooding is common near rivers and in low-lying areas, while drier years might receive only 12 inches (300 mm) of precipitation; average annual precipitation ranges from 21 inches (530 mm) in western sections up to 35 inches (890 mm) in southeast.  The wettest months of the year are April and May.\nInternational areas with comparable climate: Israel; Lebanon\n\nPiney Woods\nThe Piney Woods is the eastern region of Texas and is within the humid subtropical climate zone. It receives the most rainfall; more than 60 inches (1,500 mm) annually in the far east. This is due to the gulf currents that carry humid air to the region, where it condenses and precipitates out in the vicinity of sea breeze fronts as well as when extratropical cyclones move by.  While coastal sections see the most cloudy days statewide and year-round, northern sections see the most clear days during the summer.  The wettest months of the year are April and May.  The area is prone to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes when the proper conditions exist, generally in the springtime.  Hurricanes also strike the region, the most disastrous of which was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900.  More recently Hurricane Rita pummeled the Golden Triangle of southeast Texas.  The higher humidity of the region amplifies the feeling of heat during the summer.  During winter and spring along the immediate coast, temperatures are kept cool by relatively cool gulf waters.  Dense advection fog can form when warm air moves over the cool shelf waters during February and March, stopping ship traffic for days.\nInternational areas with comparable climate: Taiwan; Philippines; much of the Southern parts of Queensland, Australia\n\nSouth\nThe region of South Texas includes the semiarid ranch country and the wetter Rio Grande Valley. Considered to be the southernmost tip of the American Great Plains region, the inland region has rainfall that is similar to that of the Northern Plains. The coastal areas are nearly warm most of the year due to currents of the Gulf of Mexico.  Summers are hot and humid.  Rain in the coastal region is more abundant than in the inland region, and subtropical forests line the Rio Grande.  The wettest months of the year are April and May in western areas, but approaching the Gulf Coast, September becomes the year's wettest month on average. This owes to the threat from tropical weather systems, including hurricanes, which can bring torrential rains of 5 to 10 inches (130 to 250 mm) in one or two days. The resulting September monthly rainfall maximum prevails, for example, at Corpus Christi, South Padre Island and Brownsville. Inland, where it is drier, ranches dominate the landscape, characterized by thick spiny brush and grasslands. The winters in the inland region are variable, but usually mild. Snow is a rare occurrence due to the lack of humidity in winter, and the summers are for the most part hot and dry, but at times can be humid when winds come off the Gulf of Mexico.  Tornadoes can occur in this region, but are less frequent than in other parts of the state.\nThe southernmost part of the state falls just within the tropical climate classification. Occasional years of above average temperatures result in an abundance of tropical flora in the lower Rio Grande Valley, typical of a tropical savanna climate.\nInternational areas with comparable climate: India; Vietnam; Thailand\n\nCold and snow\nNorthern and western sections of the state average snowfall annually due to their colder average readings each winter.  For one week in February 1956, a snow storm of historic proportions struck northern Texas.  The maximum amount measured was 61 inches (150 cm) at Vega with Plainview receiving 24 inches (61 cm) in one day.  El Paso, in Far West Texas, received 22.4 in (57 cm) of snow during a 24-hour period December 13\u201314, 1987.  For central and southern sections, snowfall is considerably more unusual.  In February 1895, a large area of southeastern Texas received over 12 inches (30 cm) of snow, with peak amounts near 30 inches (76 cm) at Port Arthur.  More recently around Christmas of 2004, up to 13 inches (33 cm) of snow fell along the middle coast, with the maximum occurring at Victoria.\nOne of the worst cold snaps to occur statewide occurred during the last half of December in 1983.  Four stations recorded their longest continuous readings at or below 32 \u00b0F (0 \u00b0C) on record. Lubbock saw temperatures at or below freezing for 9 days (207 hours).  The Dallas-Fort Worth airport measured temperatures at or below freezing for a total of 296 consecutive hours (12 days).  Snow which fell on December 14 and 15 across northern Texas stayed on the ground until New Year's Day of 1984.\nFebruary 2021 was another record-setting cold snap. At Austin, the temperature remained at or below freezing for 7 days (168 hours). At Abilene, the period at or below freezing totaled 10 days (252 hours). The Central Texas region, including Waco, Bryan, and Killeen, set a new record with 9 days (205 hours) at or below freezing. San Angelo endured 6 days (152 hours) at or below freezing temperatures.\n\nSevere weather\nThunderstorms are very common in Texas, especially the eastern and northern portion. Texas is part of the Tornado Alley section of the country. The state experiences the most tornadoes in the Union, an average of 139 a year. These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle. Tornadoes in Texas generally occur in April, May, and June.\n\nHurricanes\nTexas's position at the northwestern end of the Gulf of Mexico makes it vulnerable to hurricanes. Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed approximately 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town, which was at the time the most important port city in the state. This allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city, but it was subsequently devastated by a hurricane in 1900 that killed approximately 8,000 people (possibly as many as 12,000), making it the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. Other devastating Texan hurricanes include the 1915 Galveston Hurricane, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Beulah in 1967, Hurricane Alicia in 1983, Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Ike in 2008 and Hurricane Harvey  in  2017.\nThe climatology of where tropical cyclone strikes are most likely within the state appears to be changing.  In the early 1980s, the most favored region during the previous century was the middle coast.  However, that region of the coastline has been rarely impacted since the 1960s, and a recent study indicates that the most vulnerable location to a tropical cyclone strike since 1851 is the upper coast, which has received 56 percent of all tropical cyclone landfalls, of which 66 percent originate from the Gulf of Mexico.  This is in contrast with Louisiana and the lower Texan coast, where only 39 percent of the landfalls are from tropical cyclones of Gulf of Mexico origin.\n\nFlooding\nThe most serious threat from tropical cyclones for Texans is from flooding.  The worst aspect about tropical cyclones is that the weaker they are, the more efficient they can be at producing heavy rains and catastrophic flooding.  Systems with sprawling circulations, such as Hurricane Beulah, also tend to make good rainmakers.  Slow moving systems, such as Tropical Storm Amelia (1978) and Hurricane Harvey (2017) can produce significant rainfall.  Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Basins can impact the Lone Star State.  In general, flooding across Texas is more common during the spring and early autumn months, and it can also be due to nearby stationary fronts interacting with strong upper level cyclones.  The most likely location for floods statewide is the Balcones Escarpment, an area of steep elevation gradient in central Texas at the boundary between the Edwards Plateau and the coastal plain.\n\nExtreme temperatures\nThe highest temperature ever measured in Texas was 120 \u00b0F (48.9 \u00b0C), recorded on August 12, 1936 in Seymour, during the 1936 North American Heatwave, and again on June 28, 1994 in Monahans. The lowest temperature ever measured in Texas was \u221223 \u00b0F (\u221230.6 \u00b0C), recorded on February 8, 1933 in Seminole.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation\nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle is a huge impact on the weather in Texas. During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, the jet stream is located west-to-east across the southern portion of the United States. Therefore, winters in Texas are colder and receive more snowfall than normal. Texas is less likely to get impacted by hurricanes due to the increased wind shear across the Atlantic. Spring to early summer yields increased rainfall especially where a low pressure system is located over the Four Corners region or northern Mexico which yields monsoon-like climate (which was exacerbated during the 2015 and 2016 spring season where the City of Houston was the hardest hit as if the climate was similar to Mumbai or Kolkata, India with heavy rainfall usually from moisture from the Gulf of Mexico). During the opposite phase, La Ni\u00f1a, the jet stream is much further north, therefore winter is milder and drier than normal. Hurricanes are more likely to impact Texas during La Ni\u00f1a due to decreased wind shear in the Atlantic. Droughts in Texas are much more likely during La Ni\u00f1a. The 2010-11 La Ni\u00f1a is mostly to blame for one of the worst droughts in Texas history.\n\nClimate change\nNotes\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "The Piney Woods is the eastern region of Texas and is within the humid subtropical climate zone.

The story follows the dysfunctional characters from the fictional town of Winden in Germany, as they pursue the truth in the aftermath of a child's disappearance. They follow connections between four estranged families to unravel a sinister time travel conspiracy that spans several generations. The series explores the existential implications of time and its effect on human nature and life. It features an ensemble cast led by Louis Hofmann.\nDark debuted on 1 December 2017 on Netflix; it is the service's first German-language original series. The second season was released on 21 June 2019, while the third and final season was released on 27 June 2020.\nDark received widespread praise for its cast acting, direction, writing, tone, visuals, musical score, and the ambition and complexity of its narrative. In 2021, the BBC ranked the series as the 58th greatest TV series of the 21st century.\n\nOverview\nChildren start vanishing from the German town of Winden, bringing to light the fractured relationships, double lives, and the dark pasts of four families living there, and unfurling a mystery that spans four generations.\nThe first season begins in 2019, but later grows to include 1986 and 1953 via time travel, when members of the show's central families become aware of a wormhole in the cave system beneath the local nuclear power plant. During the first season, secrets are revealed concerning the Kahnwald, Nielsen, Doppler, and Tiedemann families, and their lives begin crumbling as their ties are exposed. The conspiracy involves the missing children and the history of the town and its citizens.\nThe second season continues the intertwining families' attempts to reunite with their missing loved ones, several months after the first-season finale, in 2020, 1987 and 1954, respectively. Additional story-lines are set in 2053 and 1921. The second season introduces Sic Mundus Creatus Est, a major faction in the ongoing battle for the ultimate fate of the people of Winden and the world. The season counts down towards the apocalypse.\nThe third season follows the four families across time in the wake of the apocalypse in 2020. It introduces a parallel world tethered to the first. The third season continues the 1954, 1987, 2020, and 2053 storylines in the first world, while also adding a new 1888 storyline and 2019 and 2052 in the second world, as the factions further their own desires for each world. The season also showcases the main events between all of these years, continuing the events of the season while also serving as backstory for the events of the first two seasons.\n\nCast and characters\nThe first season takes place primarily in 2019 but expands to include stories set in 1986, 1953, and \u2013 in the final scene of the first season \u2013 2052, with several characters portrayed at various ages by multiple actors.\nThe second season takes place several months after the first, depicting the initial stories in 2020, 1987, and 1954, respectively, while continuing the future-set storyline into 2053, and adding a fifth storyline, set in 1921.\nThe third season introduces a storyline based in 1888 and a parallel reality featuring alternate versions of many main characters.\n\nMain characters\nRecurring cast\nJennipher Antoni as Ulla Obendorf, Erik Obendorf's mother in 2019 (season 1)\nNils Brunkhorst as the high school's science teacher in 2019 (seasons 1, 3)\nLena D\u00f6rrie as Clara Schrage, a nurse attending to Helge Doppler in 2019 (season 1)\nTara Fischer as a friend of Katharina in 1986\u20131987 (seasons 1\u20133)\nLeopold Hornung as Torben W\u00f6ller, a junior police officer in 2019\u20132020, Benni/Bernadette's brother (seasons 1\u20133)\nTom Jahn as J\u00fcrgen Obendorf, Erik Obendorf's father in 2019\u20132020 (seasons 1\u20133)\nAnna K\u00f6nig as Edda Heimann, a pathologist in 2019 (seasons 1, 3)\nVico M\u00fccke as Yasin Friese, Elisabeth Doppler's friend in 2019 (season 1)\nHenning Peker as Udo Meier, a pathologist in 1953\u20131954 (seasons 1\u20132)\nBarbara Philipp as Selma Ahrens, a caseworker in 1986 (season 1)\n Paul Radom as Erik Obendorf, a teenage drug dealer gone missing in 2019 (season 1)\nAnton Rubtsov as Benni/Bernadette, a transgender prostitute in 2019\u20132020, Torben's sister (seasons 1\u20133)\nSammy Scheuritzel as Kilian Obendorf, Erik Obendorf's brother and Martha and Bartosz's classmate in 2019's alternative world (seasons 1, 3)\nAnna Sch\u00f6nberg as Donata Kraus, a nurse and Ines Kahnwald's co-worker in 1986 (season 1)\nAndreas Schr\u00f6ders as a power plant worker in 2020 (season 2)\nMieke Schymura as Justyna Jankowski, a junior police officer in 2019\u20132020 (seasons 1\u20133)\nAxel Werner as Gustav Tannhaus, H.

The high school location was filmed at the Reinfelder Schule in Berlin's Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf neighbourhood. The bridge and the train tracks were filmed on the abandoned Wannsee-Stahnsdorf railway in the middle of the D\u00fcppeler forest near Lake Wannsee.

Vulture included the series in its article A Guide to TV Shows in the 2010s as one of the most notable shows of the decade. The BBC ranked it the 58th best TV series of the 21st century. Meanwhile, BuzzFeed listed it as one of the 25 best TV shows of all time.\n\nSeason 1\nThe first season of Dark received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many noting its similarities to the TV series Twin Peaks and another Netflix series Stranger Things. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 90%, with an average rating of 7.4 out of 10, based on 48 critics. The website's critical consensus is \"Dark's central mystery unfolds slowly, both tense and terrifying, culminating in a creepy, cinematic triumph of sci-fi noir.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream publications, gave it a score of 61, based on ten reviews.\nWriting for The Guardian, Lanre Bakare gave Dark a rating of four out of five and praised the series for its tone, the complexity of its narrative, and its pacing. Grading the series with a \"B\", Steve Greene of IndieWire wrote, \"Even when Dark is clinical in its set-up of these interweaving story threads, there's still an incredible amount of energy coursing through the show.\" From Vox, Emily St. James gave it a score of three and a half out of five and said, \"Dark is fun to try to solve \u2014 it's a treat to tease out the many connections running among the three eras. It's just that at a certain point, it becomes difficult to care about what's happening, beyond simply wanting to figure out how everything is connected.\" Ariana Romero of Refinery29 noted that the series was darker and more in-depth than Stranger Things. However, there was some criticism by Reason's Glenn Garvin for a heavy-handed approach to its message, a lack of sympathetic characters, and unoriginality of certain aspects of the series.\nLos Angeles Times listed Dark as one of the best TV series of 2017, while Thrillist named it the 18th best TV show of the year.\n\nSeason 2\nFor the second season received critical acclaim, Metacritic reports a score of 82 out of 100, based on four reviews. At Rotten Tomatoes, season two of the series holds an approval rating of 100% based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1 out of 10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Dark's sumptuous second season descends deeper into the show's meticulously-crafted mythos and cements the series as one of streaming's strongest and strangest science fiction stories.\"\nCritics referred to season two as ominous and much more bizarre than season one, and that the series managed to subvert several tropes regarding the concepts of time travel. The season received a rating of four out of five from Jack Seale of The Guardian and Boyd Hilton of Empire, a B+ grade from Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire, and an \"amazing\" score of 9 out of 10 from David Griffin of IGN. The latter wrote in his verdict: \"Dark Season 2 can hurt your brain at times, trying to piece all the time-traveling narratives together, but in the end, creators Baran bo Odar and Jantje Friese reward your patience with some stellar WTF moments. At eight episodes in length, [it] is a tightly-woven tapestry of compelling stories and memorable performances from the entire ensemble.\" TV Guide's Kaitlin Thomas was also favorably inclined towards the season, saying that \"one of the reasons Dark is such a compelling drama isn't just because it presents time travel as something that is possible or because it grounds its story in the emotional narratives of its characters, but because it couches its sci-fi themes in conversations about free will and destiny. [...] [It] excels at building a compelling mystery, and the fact that it never loses the plot itself is a testament to the writing of the series.\"\nThe season was included in many critics' year-end lists of 2019. It was ranked as the ninth and tenth best TV show of the year by Maggie Fremont of ScreenCrush and John Sellers of Thrillist, respectively. Outside the top ten, TV Guide and Complex named it the 12th and 26th best TV show of the year in their respective list. In addition, CNET and Vogue also listed it on each unranked list.\n\nSeason 3\nThe third and final season received widespread critical acclaim, with the series finale receiving particular praise for being a satisfying conclusion to the story.  It received a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 97% based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5 out of 10. The site's critical consensus says, \"Dark's final chapter is as thrilling as it is bewildering, bringing viewers full circle without sacrificing any of the show's narrative complexities.\" At Metacritic, the season received an average score of 92, based on four reviews.\nThe season received a rating of five out of five from Radio Times's Patrick Cremona and four out of five from The Guardian's Jack Seale, an A\u2212 grade from IndieWire's Steve Greene, and an \"amazing\" nine out of ten from IGN's David Griffin. Cremona deemed it as \"science fiction at its most mesmerising, its most confounding and its most exhilarating - and it all makes for a truly irresistible piece of television\" and further praised the writing, cinematography, casting, and acting (particularly that of Louis Hoffman, Maja Sch\u00f6ne, and Lisa Vicari). Griffin wrote in his verdict, \"Dark's third and final season on Netflix is a memorable journey through time and space, with thrilling character shifts and fascinating paradoxes to unpack.\" William Goodman of Complex praised the ending, saying, \"Odar and Friese masterfully close by showing the symbiotic relationship between endings and beginnings. There's no victory without sacrifice, no light without darkness, and no love without loss. The tension between each of these conflicting ideas is so interwoven, making it hard to discern where one ends and the other begins. And so Dark concludes not with a hard endpoint on a line, but by elegantly and satisfyingly circling back into itself.\"\nThe season was listed by many publications as one of the best TV shows of 2020. Radio Times named it the eighth best TV show of the year, with one of the website's writers Patrick Cremona saying, \"The final series was another irresistible piece of sci-fi television, equal parts mesmerising and confounding, with a sweeping scope that gave it the sense of a true epic. With its exhilarating finale, Dark has earned its place among the list of the very best original series made for the streamer.\" Exclaim! ranked it the tenth best TV series of the year. The website's Allie Gregory wrote, \"With stunning performances from Louis Hoffman, Oliver Masucci and Karoline Eichhorn (and an incredible score to boot), the apocalyptic time travel sci-fi series deftly concludes its mind-bending journey in its darkest (and Dark-est) instalment yet. [...] [It] manages to neatly tie up all of its loose ends to finally find the one true \"origin,\" so, at last, the town of Winden can free itself from the trappings of time and fate.\" GameSpot listed it as one of the year's ten best TV shows, with one of its writers Mike Rougeau stating, \"what really impressed us about Season 3 is how it wrapped things up, even while continuing the tradition of adding yet another new dimension (so to speak) to the show's tangled timelines. It managed to weave one of the most complex, but somehow still cohesive, sci-fi stories we've ever seen.\" Outside the top ten, Den of Geek named it the 17th best TV show of 2020. Meanwhile, Thrillist ranked it at number 19 on its \"40 Best TV Shows of 2020\" list, with one of its writers Emma Stefansky calling the series finale \"one of the most shocking and emotional conclusions to a TV show you'll see this year.\"\n\nAwards and nominations\nThe series was nominated for the Goldene Kamera TV awards 2018 in three categories: best series; best actress for Karoline Eichhorn as Charlotte Doppler; and best actor for Oliver Masucci as Ulrich Nielsen. None of these nominations resulted in awards, but Louis Hofmann received the \"Best Newcomer\" award in recognition of his lead role in Dark as well as his performances in several films.\nThe series was awarded the 2018 Grimme-Preis award in the category \"Fiction\", which singled out the following cast and crew for awards:\n\nJantje Friese (screenplay)\nBaran bo Odar (director)\nUdo Kramer (production design)\nSimone Baer (casting)\nAngela Winkler (actress)\nLouis Hofmann (actor)\nOliver Masucci (actor)\nThe actors named are awarded as \"representatives for the full cast\".\n\nSee also\nBootstrap paradox\nDark matter\nEmerald Tablet\nGrandfather paradox\nHiggs boson\nSchr\u00f6dinger's cat\nSelf-fulfilling prophecy\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nDark \u2013 The Official Guide\nDark at IMDb \nDark at Metacritic \nDark at Rotten Tomatoes"], "Ground_truth": "The American version of the crime drama television series Dark tv was filmed in Toronto and Cambridge in Ontario, Canada.

Prior to 2012, FIDE gave such recognition to a limited number of tournaments, with non-FIDE recognized tournaments annually naming a world rapid champion of their own. Since 2012, FIDE has held an annual joint rapid and blitz chess tournament and billed it as the World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships. FIDE also holds the Women's World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championship. The current rapid world champion is grandmaster Magnus Carlsen. Anastasia Bodnaruk from Russia is the current women's rapid world champion. Carlsen has won the event a record five times.\n\nTime controls\nThe concept of rapid chess (then called \"active chess\") made its debut at a 1987 FIDE Congress meeting in Seville, Spain. During the World Active Chess Championship the following year, time controls were set at 30 minutes per player per game. In 1993, following his split from FIDE, world champion Garry Kasparov organized a slightly quicker version of active chess, dubbing it \"rapid chess\". The Professional Chess Association, Kasparov's answer to FIDE, subsequently organized two Grand Prix cycles of rapid chess before folding in 1996. Under rapid chess time controls, each player was allowed 25 minutes with an additional 10 seconds after each move. FIDE would re-use these time controls and the \"rapid chess\" moniker for the 2003 FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship, held in Cap d'Agde. During the World Cup 2013, these time controls were also used for the rapid tiebreak stages.\nIn 2012, FIDE inaugurated the World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships. The current time controls for the rapid championship are set at 15 minutes per player, with a 10-second increment.\n\nFIDE-recognized events\nPrior to 2012, FIDE sporadically sanctioned a world rapid chess championship. The first official high-profile rapid match took place in 1987, when then-world champion Garry Kasparov defeated Nigel Short in the \"London Docklands Speed Chess Challenge\" at the London Hippodrome. Kasparov won the match with 4 wins, two losses, and no draws in six games.\n\n1988 World Active Chess Championship\nIn 1988, FIDE organized the inaugural World Active Chess Championship, a 61-player rapid chess tournament in Mazatlan, Mexico hosted by the Mazatlan Hoteliers Association. Notable participants included:\n\nThe event was won by Anatoly Karpov, who edged out GM Viktor Gavrikov on tiebreak points after their 1st-place playoff ended in a 5\u20135 tie. Karpov was subsequently named the new \"Active Chess Champion\", winning a $40,000 cash prize in the process. Garry Kasparov, the current world champion, declined to participate in the event and derided the concept of an active chess champion afterwards - he was quoted as saying, \"Active Chess? What does that make me, the Passive World Champion?\". The political controversy surrounding the event and the naming of a separate \"active chess champion\" led to the parallel rapid championship being dropped for future years.\n\n2001 FIDE World Cup of Rapid Chess\nIn 2001, the French Chess Federation organized the 16-player World Cup of Rapid Chess at Cannes, with support from FIDE. The tournament consisted of a round-robin stage (2 groups of eight players each), followed by a set of knockout matches to determine the winner. With the Melody Amber rapid chess tournament being held concurrently, the world's top players were split between attending both events. Nevertheless, the tournament attracted a strong field headlined by the No. 1-rated player in the world - despite the World Cup's status as an FIDE event, Kasparov's contract with the French Chess Federation led to his inclusion.\n\nIn group A, Kasparov's domination of his opponents was on display: he scored 5\u00bd/7 to finish in clear 1st place, 1\u00bd points ahead of the rest of the field. Joining him in the top 4 were Bareev, Grischuk, and Judit Polg\u00e1r, who beat out Peter Svidler in tiebreaks. In group B, Belgian grandmaster Mikhail Gurevich got off to a fast start with 3 wins in 4 games to finish atop the group with 5/7. Following him into the knockout stage were the two Frenchmen, Bacrot and Tkachiev, and Michael Adams.\n\nKasparov defeated Bareev in Game 2 of the final match to win the tournament. In the endgame, Kasparov and Bareev were left with a seemingly closed position - four pawns and a King apiece. However, the position of Kasparov's king gave him a slight advantage, and with only two seconds left on his clock, Bareev could not find the drawing line and was forced to resign.\n\nFIDE World Rapid Chess Championship 2003\nLooking to revive the World Rapid Chess Championship, FIDE gave official \"world title\" recognition to the 2003 rapid chess tournament held in Cap d'Agde, France. Hosted by the Caisse Centrale d'Activit\u00e9s Sociales des Electriciens et Gaziers de France (CCAS) on the Mediterranean coast, the 2003 tournament included eleven of the world's 12 top-ranked players along with five wild-cards. With an average rating of 2726 Elo points, the 2003 event was the strongest rapid chess tournament of all time up to that point. Included in the field were the reigning FIDE and Classical world chess champions, Ruslan Ponomariov and Vladimir Kramnik.\n\nThe field was divided into two groups of eight players each, from which eight players total would progress to the knockout stages; ties in standings were resolved by a sudden-death playoff. Vladimir Kramnik, Ruslan Ponomariov, and Etienne Bacrot scored 4\u00bd/7 to progress from Group A. Taking the final spot was Veselin Topalov, who defeated Boris Gelfand in a sudden-death playoff. In group B, Peter Svidler finished clear of the field with 5/7 to secure a spot in the quarterfinals; joining him were Alexander Grischuk, Viswanathan Anand, and Judit Polgar.\n\nKramnik, the reigning classical world champion and tournament's No. 1 seed, dispatched Polg\u00e1r and Grischuk with little difficulty to reach the final. In the other half of the bracket, Viswanathan Anand defeated Peter Svidler in a sudden-death blitz game after three drawn games to join him. After Game 1 ended in a quiet 19-move draw, Anand chose to play for complications in Game 2 in the white side of a Sveshnikov Sicilian. Following an inaccuracy from Kramnik (17... a5? 18. Na3), Anand was able to use his two knights to infiltrate Kramnik's defence, eventually forcing a queen sac to win the game and the match.\n\nWorld Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships (since 2012)\nOn May 31, 2012, FIDE announced the inaugural World Rapid & Blitz Championships, set to take place in Astana, Kazakhstan from July 1 to 11. The 2012 tournament consisted of a qualifying round, followed by the rapid and blitz events held consecutively over 5 days. In order to promote viewership, time controls were set at 15 minutes per player, rather than the pre-2012 standard of 25 minutes. The championship was originally structured as a 16-player round-robin tournament, set to coincide with the first release of FIDE's rapid and blitz ratings in July 2012; invited were the top 10 players in the FIDE ratings list, the three medalists of the qualification competition, and three wild-card nominees by the organization committee and FIDE.\nThe style has since been changed to a Swiss tournament with a field of over 100 grandmasters. The top three finishers in the standings are awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals respectively. Various methods of resolving ties have been used and the 2016 edition resulted in all three medallists tied on 11/15 points with the champion being determined by comparing the average rating of each player's opponents. From 2017 onwards, a tie-breaker match has been played in the event of two or more players being tied on points for first place. Only two players may participate in this match, even where three or more players are tied for first place on points. This caused some controversy in the 2021 edition where four players finished at the top of the tournament each with a score of 9.5/13. A tie-break match for the gold and silver medals was held between Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Ian Nepomniachtchi due to having the highest Buchholz (Cut 1) scores of the four players. Magnus Carlsen, the defending champion, and Fabiano Caruana were therefore unable to participate in the tie-break match despite having the same score as the champion. Carlsen criticised this result as 'idiotic' and called for changes.\n\nEditions and medallists\nOpen\nWomen\nRecords\nTitles (open)\nTitles (women)\nOther events\nFrankfurt/Mainz World Rapid Chess Championship\nStarting in 1994, the Chess Classic was an annual series of tournaments hosted by the Chess Tigers in Mainz, Germany. The brainchild of Hans-Walter Schmitt, the Chess Classic featured top-ranked players playing rapid and FischeRandom chess games against computers as well as each other. The main event of the classic was the Grenkeleasing Rapid World Championship (formerly Fujitsu-Siemens), a tournament generally considered as the traditional rapid chess championship in the absence of an annual FIDE-recognized championship. Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand holds the record for most championship wins, having won the event 11 times in 15 years.\nFrom 1996 to 1998, the Rapid Chess Championship at Frankfurt was organized as a double-round robin, followed by a match between the 1st and 2nd-place finishers for the championship. With the addition of Karpov to the field in 1999, the format was temporarily changed to a pure round-robin, with the 1st-place finisher winning the championship. The following year the field was expanded further to include all ten of the top 10-rated Grandmasters in the world, and was dubbed a Category 21 tournament with an average Elo rating of 2767.\nIn 2001 the event moved to Mainz, and shifted from a round-robin to a matchplay format - the defending champion Viswanathan Anand defended his title in an eight-game match against the winner of the previous year's Ordix Open, the open rapid tournament. In 2007, with Anand still the rapid champion after six successful title defenses, the event reverted to a double-round robin tournament, with the top two finishers in the semi-finals advancing to the finals. In a homage to the Masters Tournament, the winner of the championship is traditionally awarded a winner's black jacket.\nIn 2010, the event's final year, the Open GRENKE Rapid Championship featured a field of over 700 players. Shortly afterwards, the Chess Tigers withdrew financial backing for the event, due in part to the effects of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008.\n\n1 Blitz tiebreaks used to settle the outcome.\n\n2002 Eurotel World Chess Trophy\nPresented under the auspices of Online World Chess, the 2002 EuroTel Knockout Tournament was a 32-player single-elimination tournament hosted in Prague from 27 April to 5 May 2002. 14 of the world's top 15 players were in attendance, including the reigning world champion Vladimir Kramnik and the world's No. 1-ranked player Garry Kasparov. A notable omission from the field was reigning FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov. At stake was a share of the \u20ac500,000 prize fund, the largest for any chess event hosted in the Czech Republic, and the EuroTel Trophy. The finalists of the tournament were determined by a series of knock-out matches, with each match consisting of two games played at rapid time controls (25 minutes per player). Ties were broken by two blitz games, followed by a sudden-death Armageddon game.\n\nThe surprise of the tournament was Anatoly Karpov, who put together an impressive run with wins against Short, Kramnik, Morozevich, and Shirov to reach the finals. In the other half of the bracket, the No. 1 seed Kasparov was upset by Vasyl Ivanchuk in a sudden-death game after the rapid and blitz games did not produce a winner; Ivanchuk would subsequently lose to Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand in the semifinals, bowing out with a loss in the second blitz tiebreak game after both rapid games ended in a draw.\n\nIn the final, Anand defeated Karpov in Game 1 with White to take a 1\u20130 lead; Anand maneuvered his light-squared bishop to slowly gain an advantage throughout the game, before 54... a5? gave the Indian a winning advantage. In Game 2, Karpov pressed but was unable to crack Anand's Semi-Slav Defence, leading to a 34-move draw.\n\nACP World Rapid Cup\nStarting in 2007, the Association of Chess Professionals (ACP) sponsored an annual event billed as the ACP World Rapid Cup. The 1st edition of the event was a 16-player knockout tournament, jointly organized by the Pivdenny Bank of Ukraine and the ACP and held in Odesa, Ukraine at the Hotel Londonskaya from 4 January to 8 January 2007. The brainchild of Pivdenny Bank chairman and ACP president Vadim Morokhovsky, the tournament included the top finishers in each year's ACP Tour, a system in which participating players were ranked based on their performances in several chess tournaments held around the world. The remaining participants were chosen on a wild-card basis at the organizers' discretion. From 2007 to 2010, the tournament was held on an annual basis, with the 5th edition of the cup held in 2013. Despite the ACP Cup's status as a non-FIDE event, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was present at the inaugural edition of the tournament and took part in the opening ceremony. A subsequent agreement between FIDE and the ACP ensured that ACP would be able to use the title \"World\" when promoting and referring to the tournament.\nTime controls were set at 20 minutes per player, with an increment of five seconds. Each match consisted of two rapid games, with the winner progressing to the next round. Ties were resolved by two blitz games, followed by a sudden-death Armageddon game. The final match initially consisted of four rapid games, with the same tiebreaks; in 2013, the final was shortened back to two rapid games.\n\n1 Armageddon game used to settle the outcome.\n\nSee also\nWorld Blitz Chess Championship\nFast chess\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "The World Rapid Chess Championship has both men's and women's tournaments.

Their vow \"not to separate and to reassemble wherever necessary until the Constitution of the kingdom is established\" became a pivotal event in the French Revolution.\nThe Estates-General had been called to address the country's fiscal and agricultural crisis, but they had become bogged down in issues of representation immediately after convening in May 1789, particularly whether they would vote by order or by head (which would increase the power of the Third Estate, as it outnumbered the other two estates by a large margin). On 17 June, the Third Estate began to call itself the National Assembly, led by Jean Sylvain Bailly. Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau, took a prominent role.\nOn the morning of 20 June, the deputies were shocked to discover that the door of the Salle des Menus-Plaisir was locked and guarded by soldiers. They immediately feared the worst and were anxious that a royal attack was imminent from King Louis XVI, so upon the suggestion of one of their members Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor royal tennis court near the Palace of Versailles. \nThe 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate took the oath Jean Sylvain Bailly was the first one who signed; the only person who did not join was Joseph Martin-Dauch, who would only execute decisions that were made by the monarch. To prevent further sessions, the tennis court was rented on 21 or 22 June by the count of Artois, a brother of the King. Meanwhile, the Assembly moved to the Versailles Cathedral.\n\nBackground\nBefore the Revolution, French society\u2014aside from royalty\u2014was divided into three estates.  The First Estate comprised the clergy; the Second Estate was the nobility.  The rest of France\u2014some 97 per cent of the population\u2014was the Third Estate, which ranged from very wealthy city merchants to impoverished rural farmers.  The three estates had historically met in the Estates General, a legislative assembly,  but this had not happened since 1614, under the reign of Louis XIII. It was the last of the Estates General of the Kingdom of France. Summoned by King Louis XVI, the Estates General of 1789 ended when the Third Estate formed the National Assembly and, against the wishes of the King, invited the other two estates to join. This signaled the outbreak of the French Revolution. \nThe Third Estate comprised the overwhelming majority of the French population but the structure of the Estates-General was such that the Third Estate comprised a bare majority of the delegates. A simple majority was sufficient\u2014as long as delegate votes were cast together. The First and Second Estates preferred to divide the vote; a proposal might need to receive approval from each Estate or there might be two \"houses\" of the Estates-General (one for the first two Estates, and one for the Third) and a bill would need to be passed by both houses. Either way, the First and Second Estates could exercise a veto over proposals enjoying widespread support among the Third Estate, such as reforms that threatened the privileges of the nobility and clergy.\n\nOath\nThe deputies' fears, even if wrong, were reasonable and the importance of the oath goes above and beyond its context. The oath was a revolutionary act and an assertion that political authority derived from the people and their representatives rather than from the monarchy. Their solidarity forced Louis XVI to order the clergy and the nobility to join the Third Estate in the National Assembly to give the illusion that he controlled the National Assembly. This oath was vital to the Third Estate as a protest that led to more power in the Estates General, every governing body thereafter. Among the oath-takers were also five delegates from the colony of Saint-Domingue.\nThe text was prepared by Antoine Barnave and Isaac Le Chapelier. An English-language translation of the oath reads:\n\nConsidering that it has been called to establish the constitution of the realm, to bring about the regeneration of public order, and to maintain the true principles of monarchy; nothing may prevent it from continuing its deliberations in any place it is forced to establish itself; and, finally, the National Assembly exists wherever its members are gathered.\nDecrees that all members of this Assembly immediately take a solemn oath never to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require until the constitution of the realm is established and fixed upon solid foundations; and that said oath having been sworn, all members and each one individually confirms this unwavering resolution with his signature.\n\nWe swear never to separate ourselves from the National Assembly, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require until the constitution of the realm is drawn up and fixed upon solid foundations.\n\nSignificance and aftermath\nThe Oath signified for the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI. The National Assembly's refusal to back down forced the king to make concessions. It was foreshadowed by and drew considerably from the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, especially the preamble. The Oath also inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activities in the months afterwards, ranging from rioting in the French countryside to renewed calls for a written constitution. It reinforced the Assembly's strength, and although the King attempted to thwart its effect, Louis was forced to relent and on 27 June 1789 he formally requested that voting occur based on head counts, not on each estates' power. \nThe Tennis Court Oath (20 June 1789) preceded the Storming of the Bastille, Abolition of feudalism (4 August 1789) and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (26 August 1789). The members of the  National Constituent Assembly became increasingly divided. The French Constitution of 1791 redefined the organization of the French government, taxation system, male census suffrage and the limits to the powers of government.\n\nFollowing the 100 year celebration of the oath in 1889, what had been the Royal Tennis Court was again forgotten and deteriorated. Prior to World War II, there was a plan to convert it into a table tennis room for Senate administrators at the Palace. In 1989 the bicentenary of the French Revolution was an opportunity to restore the tennis court.\n\nSee also\nNational Assembly\nEstates General of 1789\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWilde, Robert (2014). \"The Estates General and the Revolution of 1789\". about.com.

The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs by the score of 35\u201310.\nComing into the game, billed by some as the \"supergame\", considerable animosity existed between the AFL and NFL, thus the teams representing the two rival leagues (Kansas City and Green Bay, respectively) felt additional pressure to win. The Chiefs posted an 11\u20132\u20131 record during the regular season, and defeated the Buffalo Bills 31\u20137 in the AFL Championship Game. The Packers finished the regular season at 12\u20132 and defeated the Dallas Cowboys 34\u201327 in the NFL Championship Game. Many sportswriters and fans believed any team in the older NFL was vastly superior to any club in the upstart AFL, and so expected Green Bay would blow out Kansas City.\nThe first half of Super Bowl I was competitive, as the Chiefs outgained the Packers in total yards, 181\u2013164, and kept pace with Green Bay by posting a 14\u201310 score at halftime. Early in the third quarter, Green Bay safety Willie Wood intercepted a pass and returned it 50 yards to the 5-yard line. The turnover sparked the Packers to score 21 unanswered points in the second half. Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr, who completed 16 of 23 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception, was named MVP.\nAs NBC and CBS had held the rights to nationally televise AFL and NFL games, respectively, it was decided that both networks were allowed to televise the game. The game remains the only Super Bowl to have been simulcast in the United States by two of the \"Big Three\" broadcast companies, though Super Bowl LVIII was simultaneously broadcast on CBS and its sister network Nickelodeon on February 11, 2024.\n\nBackground\nOrigins\nWhen the NFL began its 41st season in 1960, it had a new and unwanted rival: the American Football League. The NFL had successfully fended off several other rival leagues in the past, and so the older league initially ignored the new upstart and its eight teams, figuring it would be made up of nothing but NFL rejects, and that fans were unlikely to prefer it to the NFL. But unlike the NFL's prior rivals, the AFL survived and prospered, in part by signing \"NFL rejects\" who turned out to be highly talented players the older league had badly misjudged. Soon the NFL and AFL found themselves locked in a massive bidding war for the top free agents and prospects coming out of college. Originally, there was a tacit agreement between the two not to raid each other by signing players who were already under contract with a team from an opposing league. This policy broke down in early 1966 when the NFL's New York Giants signed Pete Gogolak, a placekicker who was under contract with the AFL's Buffalo Bills. The AFL owners considered this an \"act of war\" and immediately struck back, signing several contracted NFL players, including eight of their top quarterbacks.\nEventually, the NFL had enough and started negotiations with the AFL in an attempt to resolve the issue. As a result of the negotiations, the leagues signed a merger agreement on June 9, 1966. Among the details, both leagues agreed to share a common draft to end the bidding war for the top college players, as well as merge into a single league after the 1969 season. In addition, an \"AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game\" was established, in which the AFL and NFL champions would play against each other in a game at the end of the season to determine which league had the best team.\nLos Angeles wasn't awarded the game until December 1, less than seven weeks before the kickoff; likewise, the date of the game was not set until December 13. Since the AFL Championship Game originally was scheduled for Monday, December 26, and the NFL Championship Game for Sunday, January 1, the \"new\" championship game was suggested to be played Sunday, January 8. An unprecedented TV doubleheader was held on January 1, with the AFL Championship Game telecast from Buffalo on NBC and the NFL Championship Game telecast from Dallas on CBS three hours later.\nComing into this \"first\" game, considerable animosity still existed between the two rival leagues, with both of them putting pressure on their respective champions to trounce the other and prove each league's dominance in professional football. Still, many sportswriters and fans believed the game was a mismatch, and any team from the long-established NFL was far superior to the best team from the upstart AFL.\nThe players' shares were $15,000 each for the winning team and $7,500 each for the losing team. This was in addition to the league championship money earned two weeks earlier: the Packers' shares were $8,600 each and the Chiefs' were $5,308 each.\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nThe Chiefs entered the game after an 11\u20132\u20131 regular season and a decisive 31\u20137 road win over the defending AFL champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL championship game on New Year's Day.\nKansas City's high-powered offense led the AFL in points scored (448) and total rushing yards (2,274). Their trio of running backs, Mike Garrett (801 yards), Bert Coan (521 yards), and Curtis McClinton (540 yards) all ranked among the top-ten rushers in the AFL. Quarterback Len Dawson was the top-rated passer in the AFL, completing 159 of 284 (56%) of his passes for 2,527 yards and 26 touchdowns. Wide receiver Otis Taylor provided the team with a great deep threat by recording 58 receptions for 1,297 yards and eight touchdowns. Receiver Chris Burford added 58 receptions for 758 yards and eight touchdowns, and tight end Fred Arbanas, who had 22 catches for 305 yards and four touchdowns, was one of six Chiefs offensive players who were named to the All-AFL team.  Kansas City's offensive line was led by tackle Jim Tyrer, who had been selected to the AFL Pro Bowl for the 5th time in his career.\nThe Chiefs also had a strong defense, with All-AFL players Jerry Mays and Buck Buchanan anchoring their line. Linebacker Bobby Bell, who was also named to the All-AFL team, was great at run stopping and pass coverage. The strongest part of their defense, though, was their secondary, led by All-AFL safeties Johnny Robinson and Bobby Hunt, who each recorded 10 interceptions, and Fred Williamson, who recorded four. Their head coach was Hank Stram.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nThe Packers were an NFL dynasty, turning around what had been a losing team just eight years earlier. The team had posted an NFL-worst 1\u201310\u20131 record in 1958 before head coach Vince Lombardi was hired in January 1959. \"Their offense was like a conga dance\", one sportswriter quipped. \"1, 2, 3 and kick.\"\nLombardi was determined to build a winning team. During the preseason, he signed Fred \"Fuzzy\" Thurston, who had been cut from three other teams, but ended up becoming an All-Pro left guard for Green Bay. Lombardi also made a big trade with the Cleveland Browns that brought three players to the team who would become cornerstones of the defense: linemen Henry Jordan, Willie Davis, and Bill Quinlan.\nLombardi's hard work paid off, and the Packers improved to a 7\u20135 regular-season record in 1959. They surprised the league during the following year by making it to the 1960 NFL Championship Game. Although the Packers lost, 17\u201313, to the Philadelphia Eagles, they had sent a clear message that they were no longer losers. Green Bay went on to win NFL Championships in 1961, 1962, 1965, and 1966.\nPackers veteran quarterback Bart Starr was the top-rated quarterback in the NFL for 1966, and won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award, completing 156 of 251 (62.2%) passes for 2,257 yards (9.0 per attempt), 14 touchdowns, and only three interceptions. His top targets were wide receivers Boyd Dowler and Carroll Dale, who combined for 63 receptions for 1,336 yards. Fullback Jim Taylor was the team's top rusher with 705 yards, adding four touchdowns, and caught 41 passes for 331 yards and two touchdowns. (Before the season, Taylor had informed the team that instead of returning to the Packers in 1967, he would play out his option and sign with the expansion New Orleans Saints. Lombardi, infuriated at what he considered to be Taylor's disloyalty, refused to speak to Taylor the entire season.) The team's starting halfback, Paul Hornung, was injured early in the season and replaced by running back Elijah Pitts, who gained 857 all-purpose yards. The Packers' offensive line was also a big reason for the team's success, led by All-Pro guards Jerry Kramer, and Fuzzy Thurston, and tackle Forrest Gregg.\nGreen Bay also had an excellent defense that displayed their talent in the NFL championship game, stopping the Dallas Cowboys on four consecutive plays starting from the Packers 2-yard line on the final drive to win the game. Lionel Aldridge had replaced Quinlan, but Jordan and Davis still anchored the defensive line; linebacker Ray Nitschke excelled at run stopping and pass coverage, while the secondary was led by Herb Adderley and Willie Wood. Wood was another example of how Lombardi found talent nobody else could see. Wood had been a quarterback in college and was not drafted by an NFL team. When Wood joined the Packers in 1960, he was converted to a free safety and went on to make the All-Pro team nine times in his 12-year career.\n\nPregame news and notes\nMany people considered it fitting that the Chiefs and the Packers would be the teams to play in the first-ever AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game. Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt had founded the AFL, while Green Bay was widely considered one of the best teams in NFL history (even if they could not claim to be founding members of their league, as the Packers joined the NFL in 1921, a year after the league's formation). Lombardi was under intense pressure from the entire NFL to make sure the Packers not only won the game but preferably won big to demonstrate the superiority of the NFL. CBS announcer Frank Gifford, who interviewed Lombardi before the game, said Lombardi was so nervous, \"he held onto my arm and he was shaking like a leaf. It was incredible.\" The Chiefs saw this game as an opportunity to show they were good enough to play against any NFL team. One player who was looking forward to competing in this game was Len Dawson, who had spent three years as a backup in the NFL before joining the Chiefs. However, the Chiefs were also nervous. Linebacker E. J. Holub said, \"the Chiefs were scared to death. Guys in the tunnel were throwing up.\"\nIn the week before the game, Chiefs cornerback Fred \"The Hammer\" Williamson garnered considerable publicity by boasting he would use his \"hammer\" \u2013 forearm blows to the head \u2013 to destroy the Packers' receivers, stating, \"Two hammers to (Boyd) Dowler, one to (Carroll) Dale should be enough.\"\nThe Packers practiced at UC Santa Barbara, and the Chiefs at Veterans Field in Long Beach.\nThe temperature was mild with clear skies. \nThe two teams played with their respective footballs from each league; the Chiefs' offense used the AFL ball, the slightly narrower and longer J5V by Spalding, and the Packers played with the NFL ball, \"The Duke\" by Wilson.\nThe AFL's two-point conversion rule was not in force; the NFL added the two-point conversion in 1994 and it was first used in the Super Bowl (XXIX) that season, in January 1995.\nThis was only Super Bowl where the numeric yard markers were five yards apart, rather than ten as is customary today. In 1972, marking yard lines ending in \"5\" was disallowed in the NFL in order to standardize field markings. It was also the last professional gridiron game ever played with double-support goalposts. The \"slingshot\" goalpost, with a single support, had made its debut a few weeks before Super Bowl I in the 1966 CFL playoffs. It became standard across all three professional leagues then operating in 1967.\nJustin Peters of Slate watched all the Super Bowls over a two-month period in 2015 before Super Bowl 50. He mentioned the first Super Bowl's having \"two dudes in rocket packs who flew around the stadium. I can forgive a lot of bad football as long as the game features two dudes in honest-to-God rocket packs.\"\nTickets for this game were priced at twelve, ten, and six dollars, which was equivalent to $109, $90, and $55 in 2023 when adjusted for inflation.\n\nBroadcasting\nAt the time, NBC held the rights to nationally televise AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game, each using its own announcers. Ray Scott (doing play-by-play for the first half), Jack Whitaker (doing play-by-play for the second half) and Frank Gifford provided commentary on CBS, while Curt Gowdy and Paul Christman were on NBC. This is the only Super Bowl that Curt Gowdy called for NBC where the NFL or NFC team won (the AFL/AFC teams won the others, even though the Baltimore Colts and Pittsburgh Steelers were part of the old NFL before moving to the AFC following the AFL\u2013NFL merger).\nHowever, during the week preceding the game, tensions flared between the staff of the two networks (longtime arch-rivals in American broadcasting), who each wanted to win the rating war, to the point where a fence was built between the CBS and NBC trucks. In addition, Rozelle decreed that NBC would not be able to use its cameramen and technical personnel, instead forcing it to use the feed provided by CBS, since the Coliseum was home to the NFL's Rams.\nThis game remains the only Super Bowl to have been broadcast in the United States by two of the \"Big Three\" broadcast companies. It was the only NFL game to be carried nationally on more than one broadcaster until the same two networks (as well as NFL Network and various local ABC and MyNetworkTV affiliates) carried a game between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants on December 29, 2007, and it will cease to remain the only Super Bowl to simulcast on multiple American networks when Super Bowl LVIII alternatively broadcasts on CBS and its sister network Nickelodeon in February 2024.\nSuper Bowl I was the only Super Bowl that was not a sellout, despite the TV blackout in Los Angeles (at the time, the local blackout was required even at a neutral site and even if the stadium did sell out), shutting out the vast Los Angeles market and network-owned stations KNXT (Channel 2, CBS; now KCBS-TV) and KNBC (Channel 4, NBC). Of the 94,000-seat capacity in the Coliseum, 33,000 went unsold. Days before the game, local newspapers printed editorials about what they viewed as an exorbitant ticket price of $12 (equivalent to $110 in 2023), and wrote stories about how viewers could pull in the game from stations in surrounding markets such as Bakersfield, Santa Barbara and San Diego.\n\nRatings\nCBS received a 22.6 rating and a market share of 43 for its broadcast, which was seen by 26.75 million people. NBC received an 18.5 rating and a market share of 36 for its broadcast, which was seen by 24.43 million people. Combined, the game received a market share of 79 and reached 51.18 million viewers.\n\nLost recording\nAll known broadcast tapes of the game in its entirety were subsequently wiped by both NBC and CBS to save costs, a common practice in the TV industry at the time, as videotapes were very expensive (one half-hour tape cost around $300 at the time, equivalent to $2,700 in 2023 dollars), plus it was not foreseen how big the game was going to become. This has prevented studies comparing each network's respective telecast.\nFor many years, only two small samples of the telecasts were known to have survived, showing Max McGee's opening touchdown and Jim Taylor's touchdown run. Both were shown in 1991 on HBO's Play by Play: A History of Sports Television and on the Super Bowl XXV pregame show. In January 2011, a partial recording of the CBS telecast was reported to have been found in a Pennsylvania attic and restored by the Paley Center for Media in New York. The two-inch color videotape is the most complete version of the broadcast yet discovered, missing only the halftime show and most of the third quarter. The NFL owns the broadcast copyright and has blocked its sale or distribution. After remaining anonymous and communicating with the media only through his lawyer since the recording's discovery, the owner of the recording, Troy Haupt, came forward to The New York Times in 2016 to tell his side of the story. The Paley Center has restored and digitized the footage and was scheduled to show the recording to the public for the first time on February 10, 2024, as part of an exhibit, being staged in partnership with the NFL and the Pro Football Hall of Fame, on the history of the Super Bowl called \"Beyond the Big Game\".\nNFL Films had a camera crew present, and retains a substantial amount of film footage in its archives, some of which have been released in its film productions. One such presentation was the NFL's Greatest Games episode about this Super Bowl, entitled The Spectacle of a Sport (also the title of the Super Bowl I highlight film).\nOn January 11, 2016, the NFL announced that \"in an exhaustive process that took months to complete, NFL Films searched its enormous archives of footage and were able to locate all 145 plays from Super Bowl I from more than a couple of dozen disparate sources. Once all the plays were located, NFL Films was able to put the plays in order and stitch them together while fully restoring, re-mastering, and color-correcting the footage. Finally, audio from the NBC Sports radio broadcast featuring announcers Jim Simpson and George Ratterman was layered on top of the footage to complete the broadcast. The final result represents the only known video footage of the entire action from Super Bowl I.\" It then announced that NFL Network would broadcast the newly pieced together footage in its entirety on January 15, 2016\u2014the 49th anniversary of the contest. This footage was nearly all on film with the exception of several player introductions and a post-game locker room chat between Pat Summerall and Pete Rozelle.\n\nCeremonies and entertainment\nThe Los Angeles Ramettes, majorettes who had performed at all Rams home games, entertained during pregame festivities and after each quarter. Also during the pregame, the University of Arizona marching band created a physical outline of the continental United States at the center of the field, with the famed Anaheim High School drill team placing banners of each NFL and AFL team at each team's geographical location.\nThe postgame trophy presentation ceremony was handled by CBS' Pat Summerall and NBC's George Ratterman. Summerall and Ratterman were forced to share a single microphone.\n\nHalftime show\nThe halftime show was produced by Tommy Walker, and featured trumpeter Al Hirt, the marching bands from the University of Arizona and Grambling College, the Ana-Hi-Steppers (more information below), 300 pigeons, 10,000 balloons and a flying demonstration by the hydrogen-peroxide-propelled Bell Rocket Air Men. In addition, the halftime featured a local high school drill team, the Ana-Hi-Steppers from Anaheim High School. The team joined the two university marching bands to form an outline of a United States map. Their transportation to and from the game was by school bus. This team was chosen due to their connection to Tommy Walker, whose children attended Anaheim High School. He had seen the Ana-Hi-Steppers perform and chose them over nationally famous drill teams since he only had three weeks to cast and produce the show.\n\nGame summary\nBalls from both leagues were used \u2013 when the Chiefs were on offense, the official AFL football (Spalding J5V) was used, and when the Packers were on offense, the official NFL ball (Wilson's \"The Duke\") was used. Even the officiating crew was a combination of AFL and NFL referees, with the NFL's Norm Schachter as the head referee.\n\nFirst quarter\nAfter the teams traded punts on their first possessions, the Packers drove 80 yards in six plays. The drive was highlighted by quarterback Bart Starr's passes to tight end Marv Fleming for 11 yards, to running back Elijah Pitts for 22 yards on a scramble, and to wide receiver Carroll Dale for 12 yards. The drive ended with Starr's 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Max McGee, who had replaced re-injured starter Boyd Dowler earlier in the drive, giving Green Bay an early 7\u20130 lead. (Dowler had injured his shoulder two weeks prior after scoring a third-quarter touchdown; Cowboys safety Mike Gaechter had upended him several steps after scoring and he landed awkwardly.) McGee slipped past Chiefs cornerback Willie Mitchell, made a one-handed catch at the 23-yard line, and then went the distance for the touchdown. (McGee had also caught a touchdown pass after replacing an injured Dowler in the NFL championship game). On their ensuing drive, Kansas City moved the ball to Green Bay's 33-yard line, during which quarterback Len Dawson completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Fred Arbanas and running back Mike Garrett rushed for 9 yards, but kicker Mike Mercer missed a 40-yard field goal attempt wide left. The Packers picked up 3 yards on the next play to end the first quarter.\n\nSecond quarter\nKansas City forced a three-and-out to start the second quarter, then got on the board with a six-play, 66-yard scoring drive, featuring passes by Dawson to Garrett for 15 yards, and to wide receiver Otis Taylor for 31 yards, which set up 1st-and-goal for the Chiefs at the Packers' 7-yard line. Dawson then threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to fullback Curtis McClinton to tie the game, 7\u20137. But the Packers responded with a 73-yard scoring drive on their next possession, which was again highlighted by Starr's key passes. On the third play of the drive, Starr appeared to complete a 64-yard touchdown pass to Dale, but this was nullified by a false start penalty against Green Bay. As the drive continued, however, Starr converted four straight third downs; he hit McGee for 10 yards on 3rd-and-6, then Dale for 15 on 3rd-and-10, then Fleming for 11 on 3rd-and-5, and then Pitts for 10 on 3rd-and-7 to set up fullback Jim Taylor's 14-yard touchdown run with the team's famed Packers sweep play. Taylor's rushing touchdown was the first in Super Bowl history.\nOn the first play of the Chiefs' next drive, defensive end Lionel Aldridge and defensive tackle Henry Jordan shared a sack on Dawson for an 8-yard loss, but he followed it up with four consecutive completions for 58 yards, including a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Chris Burford. This set up Mercer's 31-yard field goal to cut the Chiefs' deficit to 14\u201310 at the end of the half.\nAt halftime, the Chiefs appeared to have a chance to win. Many people watching the game were surprised at how close the score was and how well the AFL's champions were playing. Kansas City outgained Green Bay in total yards, 181\u2013164, and had 11 first downs compared to the Packers' nine. The Chiefs were exuberant at halftime. Hank Stram said later, \"I honestly thought we would come back and win it.\" The Packers were disappointed with the quality of their play in the first half. \"The coach was concerned\", said defensive end Willie Davis later. Lombardi told them the game plan was sound, but that they had to tweak some things and execute better.\n\nThird quarter\nOn their first drive of the second half, the Chiefs advanced to their 49-yard line with a chance to take their first lead of the game. But on a third-down pass play, a heavy blitz by linebackers Dave Robinson and Lee Roy Caffey collapsed the Chief's pocket. Robinson, Jordan, and Aldridge converged on Dawson, who threw weakly toward Arbanas. The wobbly pass was intercepted by safety Willie Wood, who raced 50 yards to Kansas City's 5-yard line before being dragged down from behind by Garrett. This was \"the biggest play of the game,\" wrote Starr later. The Packers capitalized on the turnover on the next play with a 5-yard touchdown run by Pitts to increase their lead to 21\u201310. Stram agreed that it was the critical point of the game. The Packers' defense then held the Chief scoreless for the rest of the game, allowing them to cross midfield only once, and for just one play. The Chiefs were forced to deviate from their game plan, and that hurt them. The Kansas City offense totaled only 12 yards in the third quarter, and Dawson was held to five of 12 second-half pass completions for 59 yards.\nMeanwhile, Green Bay forced Kansas City to punt from their two-yard line after sacking Dawson twice and got the ball back with good field position on their own 44-yard line (despite a clipping penalty on the punt return). McGee subsequently caught three passes for 40 yards on a 56-yard drive. Taylor ran for one first down, Starr hit McGee for 16 yards on 3rd-and-11, and a third-down sweep with Taylor carrying gained 8 yards and a first down at the Kansas City 13. The drive ended with Starr's 13-yard touchdown pass to McGee on a post pattern, giving Green Bay a 28\u201310 lead.\n\nFourth quarter\nAfter two punts by Kansas City and an interception at their own 11-yard line by Chiefs cornerback Willie Mitchell, midway through the fourth quarter, Starr completed a 25-yard pass to Dale and a 37-yard strike to McGee, moving the ball to the Chiefs' 18-yard line. Six plays later, Pitts scored his second touchdown of the game on a 1-yard run to close out the scoring, giving the Packers the 35\u201310 win. Also, in the fourth quarter, Chiefs defensive back Fred Williamson, who had boasted about his \"hammer\" before the game, was knocked out when his head collided with Packers running back Donny Anderson's knee, and then suffered a broken arm when Chiefs linebacker Sherrill Headrick fell on him. Williamson had three tackles for the game.\nPackers halfback Paul Hornung was the only Packer to not see any action. Lombardi had asked him in the fourth quarter if he wanted to go in, but Hornung declined, not wanting to aggravate a pinched nerve in his neck. McGee, who caught only four passes for 91 yards and one touchdown during the season, finished Super Bowl I with seven receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns. After the game was over, a reporter asked Vince Lombardi if he thought Kansas City was a good team. Lombardi responded that though the Chiefs were an excellent, well-coached club, he thought several NFL teams such as Dallas were better.\n\nBox score\nFinal statistics\nSources: NFL.com Super Bowl I, Super Bowl Play Finder GB, Super Bowl Play Finder KC\n\nStatistical comparison\nNote: According to NBC Radio announcer Jim Simpson's report at halftime of the game, Kansas City led 11\u20139 in first downs at halftime, 181\u2013164 in total yards, and 142\u2013113 in passing yards (Green Bay led 51\u201339 in rushing yards). Bart Starr completed eight of 13 with no interceptions, while Len Dawson was 11 of 15 with no interceptions. Green Bay led 14\u201310 at halftime. Green Bay had the ball five times, although only for a minute or so on the last possession; they punted on their first possession, scored a touchdown on their second, punted on their third, scored a touchdown on their fourth, and had the ball when the half ended on their fifth. Kansas City had the ball four times \u2013 punting on their first possession, driving to a missed field goal on their second possession, scoring a touchdown on their third, and kicking a field goal on their fourth.\nThis means, in the second half, Green Bay led 12\u20136 in first downs, 197\u201358 in total yards, 115\u201325 in passing yards, and 82\u201333 in rushing yards (the Packers won the second half, 21\u20130). Starr and his late-game replacement, Zeke Bratkowski, were eight for 11 with one interception; Dawson and his late-game replacement, Pete Beathard, were just six for 17, also with one interception. Each team had the ball seven times in the second half, although Green Bay's first possession was just one play and their seventh possession was abbreviated because the game ended. Green Bay scored a touchdown on their first (one play) possession, punted on their second, scored a touchdown on their third, was intercepted at Kansas City's 15-yard line on their fourth (just Starr's fourth interception of the year), scored a touchdown on their fifth, punted on their sixth, and had the ball when the game ended on their seventh possession. Kansas City was intercepted on their first possession \u2013 Wood's return to the five set up Pitts' touchdown which made the score 21\u201310 \u2013 and then punted on each of their next six possessions.\n\nIndividual statistics\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Long gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\n\nRecords established\nBecause this was the first Super Bowl, a new record was set in every category.

Crude oil from the Niger Delta basin comes in two types: light, and comparatively heavy \u2013 the lighter has around 36 of API gravity while the heavier has 20\u201325 of API gravity. Both types are paraffinic and low in Sulphur. Nigeria's economy and budget have been largely supported from income and revenues generated from the petroleum industry since 1960. Statistics as at February 2021 shows that the Nigerian oil sector contributes to about 9% of the entire GDP of the nation. Nigeria is a major exporter of crude oil and petroleum products to the United States of America. In 2010, Nigeria exported over one million barrels per day to the United States, representing 9% of the U.S. total crude oil and petroleum products imports and over 40% of Nigeria exports.\nThe need for holistic reforms in the petroleum industry, ease of doing business, and encouragement of local content in the industry birthed the Petroleum Industry Bill by the Goodluck Jonathan administration on 18 July 2008.\n\nHistory of oil exploration\nThe history of oil exploration in Nigeria goes back to 1903, when the Nigerian Bitumen Corporation conducted exploratory work in the country. At the onset of World War I, the firm's operations were stopped. Due to lack of technological and financial resources of small oil companies, large and strong other oil companies took over the exploration of commercial oil in the country. Thereafter, licenses were given to D'Arcy Exploration Company and Whitehall Petroleum, but neither company found oil of commercial value and they returned their licenses in 1923. A new license covering 920,000 square kilometres (357,000 square miles) was given to Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a consortium of Shell and BP (then known as Anglo-Iranian). The company began exploratory work in 1937.\nThe association was granted license to explore oil all over the territory of Nigeria but, the acreage allotted to the company in the original license was reduced in 1951 and then, between 1955 and 1957. Drilling activities started in 1951 with the first test well drilled in Owerri area. Oil was discovered in non-commercial quantities at Akata, near Eket in 1953. Prior to the Akata find, the company had spent around \u00a36 million on exploratory activities in the country. In the pursuit of commercially available petroleum, Shell-BP found oil in Oloibiri, Nigeria, in 1956. Other important oil wells discovered during the period were Afam and Bomu in Ogoni territory. Production of crude oil began in 1957, and in 1960, a total of 847,000 tonnes of crude oil was exported. Towards the end of the 1950s, non-British firms were granted license to explore for oil: Mobil in 1955, Tenneco in 1960, Gulf Oil, later Chevron in 1961, Agip in 1962, and Elf in 1962. Prior to the discovery of oil, Nigeria (like many other African countries) strongly relied on agricultural exports to supply its economy. But after nearly 50 years searching for oil in the country, Shell-BP discovered oil at Oloibiri in the Niger Delta. The first oil field began production in 1958.\n\nAfter that, the economy of Nigeria might have been expected to experience strong growth. However, competition for the profits from oil, coupled with the government keeping almost all of the profits for themselves, left little economic benefit for the people. In one interview with locals that were young at the time of oil discover, the blame was placed largely on the government and the greed of bureaucrats:I don't only blame the whites that came here, what about the government? People in the government get nearly all the money from the economy.Many citizens of Nigeria believe that they have not been able to experience the economic benefits derived from oil extraction in Nigeria. In large part due to Nigerian government officials remaining majority shareholders in the profits created by the production of Nigerian oil, leading to government capturing of nearly all oil production, and citizens not seeing socio-economic benefits.\nThe president of Nigeria as of 2023, Bola Tinubu, has taken steps to privatize the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. Decades of government ownership and control of the industry left the people at large impoverished and unable to experience any of the economic gain related to oil and gas exploration and extraction, Tinubu hopes that privatization and free markets will allow for greater equity in the space that has been rife with corruption since the 1950s in Nigeria when petroleum products were first discovered.\n\nProduction and exploration\nAs of 2000, oil and gas exports accounted for more than 98% of export earnings and about 83% of federal government revenue, as well as generating more than 14% of its GDP. It also provides 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 65% of government budgetary revenues.\nNigeria's proven oil reserves are estimated by the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) at between 16 and 22 billion barrels (2.5\u00d7109 and 3.5\u00d7109 m3), but other sources claim that there could be as much as 35.3 billion barrels (5.61\u00d7109 m3). Its reserves make Nigeria the tenth most petroleum-rich nation and by far, the most affluent in Africa. In mid-2001, its crude oil production was averaging around 2,200,000 barrels (350,000 m3) per day. It is expected that the industry will continue to be profitable based on an average benchmark oil price of $85-$90 per barrel.\nNearly all of the country's primary reserves are concentrated in around the delta of the Niger River, but offshore rigs are also prominent in the well-endowed coastal region. Nigeria is one of the few major oil-producing nations still capable of increasing its oil output. Unlike most of the other OPEC countries. The reason for Nigeria's relative unproductivity is primarily OPEC's regulations on production, to regulate prices at the international market. More recently, production has been disrupted intermittently by the protests of the Niger Delta's inhabitants, who feel they are being exploited.\nNigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1481 wells in operation according to the Department of Petroleum Resources. The most productive region of the nation is the coastal Niger Delta Basin in the Niger Delta or \"South-south\" region, which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields. Most of Nigeria's oil fields are small and scattered, and in 1990, these small unproductive fields accounted for 62.1% of all Nigerian production. This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields, which produced 37.9% of Nigeria's petroleum at that time.\nAs a result of the numerous small fields, an extensive and well-developed pipeline network has been engineered to transport the crude oil. Also because of the lack of highly productive fields, money from the jointly operated (with the federal government) companies is constantly directed towards petroleum exploration and production.\nNigeria's petroleum is classified mostly as \"light\" and \"sweet\", as the oil is largely free of sulfur. Nigeria is the largest producer of sweet oil in OPEC. This sweet oil is similar in composition to the petroleum extracted from the North Sea. This crude oil is known as \"Bonny light\". Names of other Nigerian crudes, all of which are named according to export terminal, are Qua Ibo, Escravos blend, Brass River, Forcados, and Pennington Anfan.\nAs recently as 2010, Nigeria provided about 10% of overall U.S. oil imports and ranked as the fifth-largest source for oil imports in the U.S. However, Nigeria ceased exports to the US in July 2014, because of the impact of shale production in America; India is the largest consumer of Nigerian oil as of 2014.\nThere are six petroleum exportation terminals in the country. Shell owns two, while Mobil, Chevron, Texaco, and Agip own one each. Shell also owns the Forcados Terminal, which is capable of storing 13 million barrels (2,100,000 m3) of crude oil in conjunction with the nearby Bonny Terminal. Mobil operates primarily out of the Qua Iboe Terminal in Akwa Ibom State, while Chevron owns the Escravos Terminal located in Delta State and has a storage capacity of 3.6 million barrels (570,000 m3). Agip operates the Brass Terminal in Brass, a town 113 kilometres (70 miles) southwest of Port Harcourt and has a storage capacity of 3,558,000 barrels (565,700 m3). Texaco operates the Pennington Terminal.\n\nOffshore\nAs of 2005, oil companies in Africa investigated offshore production as an alternative area of production. Deepwater production mainly involved underwater drilling that exists 400 metres (1,300 ft) or more below the surface of the water to expand the possible sources for finding new oil reserves. As of 2005, 50% more oil could be extracted through deep water drilling, than before. In 2003, the amount of oil extracted from Nigeria was expected to expand from 15,000 barrels per day (2,400 m3/d) to 1.27 million barrels per day (202,000 m3/d) in 2010.\nDeepwater oil production is less vulnerable to disturbance by local militant attacks and seizures, due to civil conflicts, and sabotage. These advancements offer more resources and alternatives to extract the oil from the Niger Delta, with less exposure to conflict versus the operations on land. As of 2014, an open-air market for illegal crude oil operates off the Niger Delta, called the Togo Triangle.\nAs of 2021, Angola and Nigeria were the largest oil producers in Africa. In Nigeria, the deepwater sector still has a large avenue to expand and develop. The Agbami oilfields hit full production in 2005, at 250,000 barrels (40,000 m3) a day. Operated by Chevron's Star Deep and a company called Famfa, Agbami is only one offshore concession; there are others named Akpo, Bonga and Erha.\n\nNatural gas\nNatural gas reserves are well over 5,300 km3 (187\u00d710^12 cu ft), the gas reserves are three times as substantial as the crude oil reserves. The biggest natural gas initiative is the Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas Company, which is operated jointly by several companies and the states. It began exploration and production in 1999. In 2008, the government prepared a Gas Master Plan that was intended to promote natural gas production and encourage the supply of natural gas to domestic power stations so as to help alleviate the country's electricity shortages. There is also an export gas pipeline known as the West African Gas Pipeline in the works, but it has encountered numerous setbacks. The pipeline would allow for transportation of natural gas to Benin, Ghana, Togo, and Cote d'Ivoire. Much of Nigeria's natural gas is flared off.\n\nDownstream\nA decade from 1979 to 1989, motor spirit consumption in Nigeria increased from 2.3 million metric tons (MMT) to 4.4 MMT, an average annual increase of 7.5%. In 1989, motor spirit consumption grew by 12.8%. Nigeria's total petroleum refining capacity currently is 450,000 barrels (72,000 m3) per day, however, only 240,000 barrels (38,000 m3) per day was allotted during the 1990s. Subsequently, crude oil production for refineries was reduced further to as little as 75,000 barrels (11,900 m3) per day, during the regime of Sanni Abacha. There are four major oil refineries: the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Plant, which can process 125,000 barrels (19,900 m3) of crude per day, the New Port Harcourt Refinery, which can produce 150,000 barrels (24,000 m3) per day (there is also an 'Old' Port Harcourt Refinery with negligible production), as well as the now defunct Kaduna Refinery. The Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries both operate at only 30% capacity. The Dangote Refinery, expected to open during the fourth quarter of 2022 will have a daily refining capacity of 650,000 barrels (103,000 m3), increasing Nigeria's refining capacity to over 1,000,000 barrels (160,000 m3) per day.\n\nHistory and politics\nPrior to its official amalgamation into the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria by the military forces of the British Empire in 1914, the territory of Nigeria was a loose collection of autonomous states, villages, and ethnic communities. Many of these established themselves as pillars of art, trade, and politics in West Africa as late as the 19th century; four of these cultural entities, the Hausa-Fulani, the Igbo (sometimes spelled Ibo), the Yoruba and the Efik grew extremely prominent in the region before the arrival of foreigners, dictated British colonial policies, and dominate national politics in Nigeria to this day.\nThe modern Hausa and Fulani societies in northern Nigeria are the cultural successors of the Sokoto Caliphate, a theocratic state founded by Muslim reformer empire-maker Uthman dan Fodio in 1817. Geographically isolated in the north, the Caliphate was governed by Islamic laws as prescribed by dan Fodio's Kitab al-Farq and maintained greater links commercially and culturally to North Africa and the Arab states than to West Africa and the Atlantic.\nBy contrast, the Yoruba, the Igbo and the Efik in the south had regularly experienced contact with Europeans since at least the 16th century. A minority of southerners converted to Christianity even prior to the establishment of permanent British control, but the majority followed traditional indigenous religions, worshipping myriad deities with vast domains spanning both cosmic and terrestrial spheres.\nCoastal Nigerians established thriving trade both regionally and abroad, fashioning the coast into a hub for products like palm oil, a good sought after by rapidly industrialising Europe, while also serving as key source for the slave trade prior to its international banning (the region came to be known as the Slave Coast as a result).\nThe Niger Delta region, which is roughly synonymous with the Niger Delta province in location and the contemporary heart of the petroleum industry, is and was a zone of dense cultural diversity and is currently inhabited by roughly forty ethnic groups speaking an estimated 250 dialects. Some of the more relevant ethnic groups in the western part of the Niger Delta region include the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Ogoni. The Ijaw (sometimes spelled Ijo), the fourth most populous tribe in Nigeria and by far the largest in the Delta region, lived during late medieval times in small fishing villages within the inlets of the delta; however by the 16th century, as the slave trade grew in importance, Ijaw port cities like Bonny and Brass developed into major trading states which served as major exporters of fish and other goods regionally. Other states such as those of Itsekiri domain of Warri sprang up at this time as well.\nThe eastern Niger Delta region has the Efik people (Annang / Efik / Ibibio who are all related with a common language and ancestors who were all referred to as Efik or Calabar people in early Nigerian history). Their capital city of Calabar, located at the coastal southeast of Nigeria (eastern Niger Delta) served as the major trading and shipping center during the pre-colonial and colonial period. Calabar also served as the first capital of Nigeria and the point of entry of Western religion and Western education into southeastern Nigeria. The combined population of the Ibibio, Annang, and Efik people is the fourth largest language group in Nigeria.\n\nColonial legacy (1800s\u20131960s)\nEven before the combination of British control over all of present-day Nigeria's borders in 1914 from the protectorates of Southern and Northern Nigeria, British forces had begun imposing drastic political and economic policies on the Nigerian people which would lead to important consequences in the future. Originally this was done primarily through the government-owned Royal Niger Company. The company was crucial in securing most of Nigeria's major ports and monopolised coastal trade; this resulted in the severing of the ties which had linked the area to the flourishing West African regional trade network, in favour of the exportation of cheap natural resources and cash crops to industrialising nations. Most of the population eventually abandoned food production for such market-dependent crops (peanuts and cotton in the north, palm oil in the east, and cocoa in the west). From the beginning, divide and rule tactics were employed by both traders and administrators, highlighting ethno-religious differences and playing groups against one another. After 1914, the north was permitted a system of indirect rule under authoritarian leaders, while in the south the British exercised control directly.\nInterest in Nigerian oil originated in 1914 with an ordinance making any oil and mineral under Nigerian soil legal property of the Crown. By 1938 the colonial government had granted the state-sponsored company, Shell (then known as Shell D'Arcy) a monopoly over the exploration of all minerals and petroleum throughout the entire colony. Commercially viable oil was discovered by Shell in 1956 roughly 90 kilometres (56 mi) west of the soon-to-be oil capital of Port Harcourt at Oloibiri, now in Bayelsa State; initially a 50\u201350 profit sharing system was implemented between the company and the government. Until the late 1950s concessions on production and exploration continued to be the exclusive domain of the company, then known as Shell-BP. However, other firms became interested and by the early 1960s Mobil, Texaco, and Gulf had purchased concessions.\nIn October 1960, Nigeria gained full independence from Britain with the British monarch continuing to preside as Head of State, but the country quickly altered its relationship with its former colonizers by declaring Nigeria a republic of three federated states (the Eastern, Western and Northern Regions). But the flaring of ethnic tensions assured that this new republic would be short-lived, as on 15 January 1966, a small group of army officers consisting mostly of southeastern Igbos, staged a successful coup d'\u00e9tat against the civilian government. The federal military government which assumed power under General Aguiyi-Ironsi was unable to quiet ethnic tensions or produce a constitution acceptable to all sections of the country. In fact, its efforts to abolish the federal structure exacerbated the growing unrest and led to another coup, led by largely northern officers in July of the same year. This second coup established the regime of Major General Yakubu Gowon. Subsequently, the massacre of thousands of Igbo in the north prompted hundreds of thousands to return to the southeast, where increasingly strong Igbo secessionist sentiment emerged under the leadership of the Igbo military governor Lieutenant Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu.\nWith tensions stoked between the Eastern region and Gowon's federal government, on 4\u20135 January 1967, in compliance with Ojukwu's desire to meet for talks only on neutral soil, a summit attended by Gowon, Ojukwu and other members of the Supreme Military Council was held at Aburi in Ghana, the stated purpose of which was to resolve all outstanding conflicts and establish Nigeria as a confederation of regions. The outcome of this summit was the Aburi Accord, the differing interpretations of which would soon cause Ojukwu to declare Biafran independence and plunge Nigeria into civil war.\n\nImplications and causes of civil war (1966\u20131970)\nIgbo withdrawal arose in part from the pogroms in the North that were aimed at Eastern people, most specifically, the Igbo. However, since the southeast encompassed most of the petroleum-rich Niger Delta, the prospect emerged of the Eastern Region gaining self-sufficiency and increasing prosperity. The exclusion of easterners from power caused many in the east to fear that oil revenues would be used to benefit areas in the north and west rather than their own. The desire to accrue profits from oil revenues combined with ethnic tensions acted as a catalyst for the Igbo-spearheaded secession.\nAdditionally, despite his denials in later years, it appears that Ojukwu's insistence on secession at the time was heavily influenced by his knowledge of the extent of the area's oil reserves. Recent evidence has suggested a tax battle waged by American oil companies contributed to the regional and ethnic tensions that would lead to the outbreak of war. It was also during this period that, again thanks to the Americans, the opacity and concomitant corruption of Nigerian oil began to crystallise. However, evidence from leaked US State Department documents have proven that Britain, through Shell-Mex & BP, still held the most influence over the Nigerian oil industry at the time the war broke out. The United States declared neutrality, with US Secretary of State Dean Rusk stating that \"America is not in a position to take action as Nigeria is an area under British influence\".\nOn top of scores of deaths, the war had a largely negative impact on the oil industry. Strife caused production of crude to drop significantly, particularly in Biafra. Total crude output decreased from 420,000 barrels per day (67,000 cubic metres per day) in 1966 at the start of the war, to only 140,000 barrels per day (22,000 cubic metres per day) in 1968. Shell alone saw a drop from 367,000 barrels per day (58,300 cubic metres per day) in 1966, to 43,000 (6,800) in 1968. And in addition to concerns about production, oil companies began experiencing uncertainty as to the future of their investments depending on who prevailed in the war. This led to relations between oil companies and the federal government becoming strained, with the government at one point accusing the oil company Safrap (now TotalFinaElf, but Elf until 1974) of favouring Biafra and enlisting the aid of France for the Biafran cause. Shell, the other major holder of concessions in the southeast, was concerned but placated and limited politically by Britain's staunch support of the Nigerian government in the war effort.\nDespite oil's prominent role in national affairs, up to this time, the Nigerian federal government had only limited involvement in the oil industry, and the government confined its financial involvement in the oil industry to taxes and royalties on the oil companies. The companies were subsequently able to set their own price on the petroleum they extracted, and dominated petroleum to such a point that laws governing the oil sector were having a negative effect on Nigerian interests. However, even during the conflict with Biafra would force changes to the relationship between federal government and the petroleum industry. Gowon's military government instituted the 1969 Petroleum Decree which dismantled the existing revenue allocation system that had divided revenue from oil taxes equally between federal and state government, instead favouring an allocation formula in which the federal government controlled the dispensation of revenues to the states.\nAfter the loss of over 2,000,000 lives, the war concluded in 1970 and resulted in a victory for the Nigerian state, as the withdrawing regions were subsequently brought back into the Nigerian fold.\n\nIndustry Nationalisation (1970\u20131979)\nIn May 1971 the Nigerian federal government, then under the control of General Yakubu Gowon, nationalised the oil industry by creating the Nigerian National Oil Corporation via a decree. Following the war with Biafra, the government felt it necessary to secure and gain more control over the oil industry. Nationalization of the oil sector was also precipitated by Nigeria's desire to join OPEC, which was encouraging member states to acquire 51% stakes and become increasingly involved in the oil sector. Although the Nigerian government had maintained involvement in the industry prior to 1971, this was accomplished mainly through business deals on concessions of the foreign firms in operation. The creation of the NNOC made government participation in the industry legally binding. The federal government would continue to consolidate its oil involvement throughout the next several decades.\nHowever, it was during the years of Gowon and his successors Murtala Mohammed and Olusegun Obasanjo known officially as the Heads of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria, who ruled amidst the oil boom of the 1970s that the political economy of petroleum in Nigeria truly became characterised by endemic patronage and corruption by the political elites, which plagues the nation to this day. At both state and federal government levels, power and therefore wealth has typically been monopolised by select lobby groups who maintain a strong tendency to 'look after their own' by financially rewarding their political supporters. At the state or community level this means that interest groups in power will reward and protect their own; this is typically based on ethnic/tribal or religious affiliation of the interest group. The heavy patronage based on tribal affiliation has fueled ethnic unrest and violence throughout Nigeria, but particularly in the Niger Delta states, where the stakes for control of the immense oil resources are very high. At the federal level, political elites have utilised patronage to consolidate power for the ruling government, not only by rewarding their political friends in the federal government, but also by paying off major interest groups at the state or tribal level in order to elicit their cooperation. Inevitably these financial favours are distributed unequally and inefficiently, resulting in concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small minority. Nigeria is ranked by the Corruption Perceptions Index 136st out of 180 countries total (for comparison, this is the same as Russia).\nFollowing the NNOC's genesis, the Nigerian government continued to garner control over oil revenues. In 1972 it declared that all property not currently owned by a foreign entity was legally the property of the government, which gained jurisdiction over the sale and allocation of concessions to foreign investors. The military regime oversaw the implementation of a number of other important milestones related to oil:\n1974: Participation in oil industry by government increases to 55%.\n1975: Decree 6 increases federal government share in oil sector to 80%, with only 20% going to the states.\n1976: First exploration and development venture by NNOC undertaken and drills to uncover commercial quantities of petroleum offshore.\n1978: Perhaps most importantly, the federal government created the Land Use Act which vested control over state lands in military governors appointed by the federal military regime, and eventually led to Section 40(3) of the 1979 constitution which declared all minerals, oil, natural gas, and natural resources found within the bounds of Nigeria to be legal property of the Nigerian federal government.\n1979: In an effort to establish further control over the industry, the government merges and restructures the NNOC and the Ministry of Petroleum to form the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, an entity which would exert more power over the allocation and sale of concessions than the NNOC. By 1979, the NNPC had also gained 60% participation in the oil industry.\n\nAttempted democracy and debt (1979\u20131983)\nDespite the vast revenues accrued by Gowon and his heirs, the junta succumbed to the demands of the civilian population, and in 1979 military head of state Olusegun Obasanjo handed over power to elected National Party of Nigeria (NPN) candidate Shehu Shagari. This event coincided with the declaration of Nigeria's Second Republic. At this juncture, the oil producing states of the Niger Delta were accounting for 82% of all federal government revenue but the population of these areas received very little compensation and demands for adequate reimbursement for the black gold extracted from their land could be heard at this time. Overall, petroleum accounted for 96% of all government external revenue but a mere 27% of the nation's GDP. However, the advent of democracy did not improve the situation.\nA 1982 Revenue Act implemented by the Shagari government would eventually be modified by yet another military regime in 1984 via Decree 36 which reduced the government share of oil revenue from 80% to 55%. States got 32.5% and 10% went to local governments. The remaining 1.5% was earmarked as a special fund to new develop oil-producing areas, but during the Shagari regime the corruption in Nigerian governance reached its zenith and capital flight out of Nigeria peaked, while people in the oil-producing areas continued to receive little or none of the oil profits. Additionally, 1980 saw oil-generated revenues attain an all-time high of US$24.9 billion but Nigeria still managed an international debt of $9 billion.\nShagari's NPN government was viewed by the majority of Nigerians as incorrigibly corrupt by the time the national elections of 1983 came about. Shagari and his subordinates steadily transformed Nigeria into a police state where Nigerian military and police forces were permitted to utilise force quite liberally in order to control the civilian population. Such repressive measures were employed to ensure victory in the forthcoming elections, and this outcome was achieved largely through the bankrupting of the federal government's treasury.\nAnother disturbing trend had also been gaining steam in Nigeria since the early 1970s: a steep drop in agricultural production correlating roughly with the rise in federal revenues from petroleum extraction. Whereas previously Nigeria had been the world's lead exporter of cocoa, production of this cash crop dropped by 43%, while productivity in other important income generators like rubber (29%), groundnuts (64%), and cotton (65%) plummeted as well between 1972 and 1983. The decline in agricultural production was not limited to cash crops amid the oil boom, and national output of staple foodstuffs also fell. This situation contrasts to Nigeria in 1960 just after independence, when despite British underdevelopment, the nation was more or less self-sufficient in terms of food supply, while crops made up 97% of all revenue from exports. The drop in production was so substantial that by the early 1980s the NPN government was forced to implement a now notorious import license scheme which essentially involved Nigeria, for the first time in its history, importing basic food items. However, as Nigerian activist and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka asserts, \"the import license scam that was used by the party as a reward and enticement for party loyalists and would-be supporters cost the nation billions of dollars...while food production in the country virtually ceased\".\n\nReturn to military rule and electoral annulment (1983\u20131993)\nFor these reasons, seizure of power by General Muhammadu Buhari a short time after the NPN government was fraudulently re-elected was initially perceived as a positive development by civilians. Buhari charged out of the gate in December 1983, declaring himself Head of the Supreme Military Council of Nigeria, he condemned the civilian government's blatant corruption and instituted programs supposedly designed to eliminate the disease of corruption. However, these measures were largely transparent and the looting of federal coffers by Nigeria's rulers continued largely unabated, \"as Shagari's officers  \u2013 both within party and government \u2013 left the country, came in and out as they pleased, while Buhari's tribunal sentence opposition figures to spells of between a hundred and three hundred years in prison for every dubious kind of crime\". The Buhari government neglected to punish even Shagari himself, a consistent trend in Nigerian's long line of dictatorial rulers, who almost universally been spared any kind of justice.\nIn 1985, another general, this time General Ibrahim Babangida, stole power and again alleged that his predecessors were corrupt violators of human rights and promised to rectify the situation, committing to a return to democracy by 1990. Nigeria had been saddled with a crushingly large international debt at this point. This was because, despite over 101 billion US dollars having been generated by the oil industry between 1958 and 1983, nearly all of these funds had been siphoned into the private bank accounts and the state sponsored pet projects maintained by the succession of Nigerian governmental elites.\nImmediately prior to Babangida's rise to power, which is viewed by some  as having been orchestrated by international oil and banking interests, the International Monetary Fund was exerting increasingly acute pressure on the Nigerian government to repay its massive debts, of which 44% of all federal revenue was already servicing. Therefore, it was unsurprising when Babangida implemented the IMF's Structural Adjustment Program in October 1986 in order to facilitate debt repayment. The SAP was extremely controversial while it was in effect between 1986 and 1988. While it did permit Nigerian exports to become more competitive internationally and spurred a degree of economic growth, the SAP also incurred a dramatic drop in real wages for the majority of Nigerians. This, combined with major cuts to important public services, incited public unrest so extreme that Babangida's Armed Forces Ruling Council was obliged to partially reverse the SAP initiatives and return to inflationary economic policies. Babangida's rule also oversaw the annihilation of the Nigerian economic middle class, and Nigeria's entry to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, despite Muslims accounting for less than 50% of the Nigerian populace.\nThe 1980s military juntas conducted several attempted re-organisations of the NNPC to increase its efficiency. However, according to most sources by the early 1990s the NNPC was characterised by chronic inefficiency and waste. Red tape and poor organisation are standard, with the NNPC being divided into several sub-entities, each fulfilling a particular function. This is despite the NNPC's growing participation in the industry, including development and exploration of numerous off-shore wells. As a result, the functionality of the industry is dependent on foreign corporations, not the NNPC.\nThe sudden jump in oil prices caused by the First Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, as most researchers confirm, was at best squandered. The Babangida junta has been widely accused of \"mismanaging\" the oil windfall from the Gulf War price jump, which accounted for about $12.5 billion in revenues. Another alleges that the federal government siphoned off about $12.2 billion between 1988 and 1994 into private accounts or expenditures, \"clandestinely undertaken while the country was openly reeling with a crushing external debt\".\nUnder these circumstances, Babangida eventually allowed for nationwide elections on 12 June 1993. These elections were declared universally free and fair (at least in comparison to past elections) by all major international election monitors, and the eventual winner of the presidential race was the Chief M.K.O. Abiola [of the newly formed SDP]. However, the military regime cynically pronounced the election, in which fourteen million Nigerians participated, to be null and void due to \"electoral irregularities\". The Nigerian people took to the streets in large numbers to protest the election's annulment. As civil unrest continued, Babangida was forced to cede power to the caretaker government of Ernest Shonekan.\n\nEnvironment of crisis (1993\u2013present)\nShonekan's interim government would be short-lived, as on 17 November 1993, Babangida's former Chief of Army Staff and Minister of Defence Sani Abacha overthrew the caretaker regime and installed himself as Head of State. Popular opposition to the junta was widespread and public demonstrations were taking place on a regular basis. Immediately upon taking power, Abacha commenced the brutal repression of these subversive elements which would make his tenure notorious on a global basis.\nThroughout the early 1990s such popular unrest grew steadily, particularly in the Niger Delta region, where various ethnic groups began demanding compensation for years of ecological damage as well as control over their land's oil resources. This unrest manifested itself at the outset as peaceful activist organisations that united their members on the basis of ethnicity.\nOne of the most prominent of these organisations to emerge in the region was the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP). The group declared that the Ogoni people, a small minority in Rivers State of Nigeria, were slowly being annihilated as the arable terrain of their homeland (known as Ogoni land) was degraded by pollution from oil production by Chevron and primarily Shell.\n\nConflict in the Niger Delta arose in the early 1990s due to tensions between the foreign oil corporations, the Nigerian federal government, and a number of the Niger Delta's ethnic groups who felt they were being exploited, particularly minority groups like the Ogoni as well as the Ijaw in the late 1990s. Ethnic and political unrest has continued throughout the 1990s and persists as of 2006 despite the conversion to a more democratic, civilian federal system under the Obasanjo government in 1999; democracy has to some degree fan the flames as politicians seeking office may now employ militia groups to coerce voters and generally disrupt the election process. Competition for oil wealth has fueled violence between innumerable ethnic groups, causing the militarisation of nearly the entire region by ethnic militia groups as well as Nigerian military and police forces (notably the Nigerian Mobile Police). Victims of crimes are fearful of seeking justice for crimes committed against them because of growing \"impunity from prosecution for individuals responsible for serious human rights abuses, [which] has created a devastating cycle of increasing conflict and violence\". The regional and ethnic conflicts are so numerous that fully detailing each is impossible and impractical.\nOn 30 January 2013, a Dutch court ruled that Shell can be held accountable for the pollution in the Niger Delta.\n\nOperating agreements\nAs of 1999, details and nature of the relationship between the government and the operating companies were governed by three types of agreements, joint ventures, production sharing contracts and service contracts.\n\nJoint-venture companies\nShell Plc. (British)\nShell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), usually known simply as Shell Nigeria: A joint venture operated by Shell accounts for 50% of Nigerian's total oil production (899,000 barrels (142,900 m3) per day in 1997) from more than eighty oil fields. The joint venture is composed of NNPC (55%), Shell (30%), TotalFinaElf (10%) and Agip (5%) and operates largely onshore on dry land or in the mangrove swamp in the Niger Delta. \"The company has more than 100 producing oil fields, and a network of more than 6,000 kilometres of pipelines, flowing through 87 flowstations. SPDC operates 2 coastal oil export terminals\". The Shell joint venture produces about 50% of Nigeria's total crude. Shell Nigeria owns concessions on four companies, they are: Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG), Shell Nigeria Oil Products (SNOP), as well as holding a major stake in Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG). Shell formerly operated alongside BP as Shell-BP, but BP has since sold all of its Nigerian concessions. Most of Shell's operations in Nigeria are conducted through the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).\nChevron (American)\nChevron Nigeria Limited (CNL): A joint venture between NNPC (60%) and Chevron (40%) has in the past been the second largest producer (approximately 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 cubic metres per day)), with fields located in the Warri region west of the Niger river and offshore in shallow water. It is reported to aim to increase production to 600,000 barrels per day (95,000 cubic metres per day).\nExxonMobil (American)\nMobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU): A joint venture between the NNPC (60%) and ExxonMobil (40%) operates in shallow water off Akwa Ibom state in the southeastern delta and averaged production of 632,000 barrels per day (100,500 cubic metres per day) in 1997, making it the second largest producer, as against 543,000 barrels per day (86,300 cubic metres per day) in 1996. Mobil also held a 50% interest in a Production Sharing Contract for a deep water block further offshore and was reported to plan to increase output to 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 cubic metres per day) by 2000. Oil industry sources indicated that Mobil was likely to overtake Shell as the largest producer in Nigeria within the next five years, if current trends continue, mainly due to its offshore base allowing it refuge from the strife Shell has experienced onshore. It has been headquartered in Eket and operating in Nigeria under the subsidiary of Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN).\nAgip (Italian)\nNigerian Agip Oil Company Limited (NAOC): A joint venture operated by Agip and owned by the NNPC (60%), Agip (20%) and ConocoPhillips (20%) produced 150,000 barrels per day (24,000 cubic metres per day) mostly from small onshore fields.\nTotal (French)\nTotal Petroleum Nigeria Limited (TPNL): A joint venture between NNPC (60%) and Elf (now Total) produced approximately 125,000 barrels per day (19,900 cubic metres per day) during 1997, both on and offshore. Elf and Mobil are in dispute over operational control of an offshore field with a production capacity of 90,000 barrels per day (14,000 cubic metres per day).\nTexaco (now merged with Chevron)\nNNPC Texaco-Chevron Joint Venture (formerly Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company of Nigeria Unlimited): A joint venture operated by Texaco and owned by NNPC (60%), Texaco (20%) and Chevron (20%) produced about 60,000 barrels per day (9,500 cubic metres per day) from five offshore fields in 1999.\n\nIndependent and indigenous oil and gas companies\nAddax Petroleum Nigeria Limited\nAiteo Group\nAMNI International Petroleum Development Company Ltd.\nConsolidated Oil Limited.\nDubri Oil Company Ltd.\nEmerald Energy Resources Ltd\nLekoil Nigeria Ltd. \nYinka Folawiyo Petroleum Company Ltd.\n\nSituation, 2019\nAs of 2007, Nigeria's oil revenue totaled $340 billion in exports since the 1970s and it was the fifth largest producer. Nigeria imports most of its motor spirit, though it is a major oil exporter, and when fuel subsidies were lifted in January 2012, fuel increased from roughly $1.70 per gallon to $3.50. As of 2019, Nigeria produced a form of oil ideal for the United States, had huge reserves, and increased its production to 2.8 million barrels (450,000 m3) of oil a day. At the same time this has been described as a resource curse hurting Nigeria and disadvantaging her people.\n\nOil theft\nIn July 2013, a report analysing the effect of oil theft in Nigeria revealed that Nigeria lost $10.9 billion in potential oil revenues between 2009 and 2011. In 2022, the country's oil industry's regulator mentioned that oil theft accounted for 108,000 barrels a day, which is about 7% of total oil production. Watchdogs reckoned that 5% to 20% of oil in Nigeria is reportedly stolen. The Trans Niger pipeline suffered so much theft that its oil flow was forced to be halted. The head of the NNPC, Mele Kyari claimed that oil companies have cut production worth 700,000 barrels per day to avoid oil theft.\nIn February 2024, personnel of \"Operation Delta Sanity\" (a special operation force of the Nigerian Navy) claimed to have recovered a total of 8,764,080 litres of stolen crude oil and other products worth \u20a67.4bn in operations conducted between February 19 and 28, 2024.\n\nProcess and Industrial Developments dispute\nProcess and Industrial Developments Ltd (P&ID) entered into a 20-year contract with the Nigerian government for natural gas supply and processing. Nigeria provided the gas, which PI&D refined so that it could be used to power the Nigerian electrical grid. PI&D could keep valuable byproducts for its own use. In 2012, PI&D demanded arbitration in London, alleging that Nigeria had not supplied the agreed quantity of gas or to construct the infrastructure it had agreed to build. The arbitral tribunal awarded damages of more than \u00a34.8 billion. The compensation was valued \u00a38.15 billion with interest when the case was heard in London High Court in December 2022.\n\nEnvironmental impact\nThe Niger Delta comprises 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of wetlands formed primarily by sediment deposition. Home to more than 20 million people and 40 different ethnic groups, this floodplain makes up 7.5% of Nigeria's total land mass. It is the largest wetland and maintains the third-largest drainage area in Africa. The Delta's environment can be broken down into four ecological zones: coastal barrier islands, mangrove swamp forests, freshwater swamps, and lowland rainforests.\nThis incredibly well-endowed ecosystem, which contains one of the highest concentrations of biodiversity on the planet, in addition to supporting an abundant flora and fauna, arable terrain that can sustain a wide variety of crops, trees, and more species of freshwater fish than any ecosystem in West Africa. The region could experience a loss of 40% of its inhabitable terrain in the next thirty years because of extensive dam construction in the region. The carelessness of the oil industry has also precipitated this situation, which can perhaps be best encapsulated by a report issued by the NNPC in 1983, long before popular unrest surfaced:\nWe witnessed the slow poisoning of the waters of this country and the destruction of vegetation and agricultural land by oil spills which occur during petroleum operations. But since the inception of the oil industry in Nigeria, more than twenty-five years ago, there has been no concerned and effective effort on the part of the government, let alone the oil operators, to control environmental problems associated with the industry.\n\nOil spills and water contamination\nOil spills in Nigeria are a common occurrence; it has been estimated that between 9 and 13 million barrels (1,400,000 and 2,100,000 m3) have been spilled since oil drilling started in 1958. The government estimates that about 7,000 spills occurred between 1970 and 2000. The process of remediating some of the contaminated site was conducted in Kwawa community, Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State, after the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released an environmental assessment of Ogoniland in 2011, a remediation project popularly refer to as OGONI CLEAN-UP.\nOil spill causes include corrosion of pipelines and tankers (accounts for 50% of all spills), sabotage (28%), and oil production operations (21%), with 1% of the spills being accounted for by inadequate or non-functional production equipment. One reason that corrosion accounts for such a high percentage of all spills is that as a result of the small size of the oilfields in the Niger Delta, there is an extensive network of pipelines between the fields. Many facilities and pipelines were constructed to older standards, are poorly maintained and have outlived their estimated life span. Sabotage is performed primarily through what is known as \"bunkering\", whereby the saboteur taps a pipeline, and in the process of extraction sometimes the pipeline is damaged. Oil extracted in this manner is often sold for cash compensation.\nOil spills have a major impact on the ecosystem. Large tracts of mangrove forests have been destroyed. They are especially susceptible to oil spills because the oil is stored in the soil and re-released annually with each inundation. An estimated 5\u201310% of Nigerian mangrove ecosystems have been wiped out either by settlement or by oil. Spills also take out crops and aquacultures through contamination of groundwater and soils. Drinking water is frequently contaminated, and a sheen of oil is visible in many localised bodies of water. If the drinking water is contaminated, even if no immediate health effects are apparent, the numerous hydrocarbons and other chemicals present in oil represent a carcinogenic risk. Offshore spills, which are usually much greater in scale, contaminate coastal environments and cause a decline in local fishing production.\nNigerian regulations are weak and rarely enforced allowing oil companies, in essence, to self-regulate.\n\nNatural gas flaring\nNigeria flares more natural gas associated with oil extraction than any other country, with estimates suggesting that of the 99,000,000 m3 (3.5\u00d710^9 cu ft) of associated gas (AG) produced annually, 71,000,000 m3 (2.5\u00d710^9 cu ft), or about 70%, is wasted via flaring. Statistical data associated with gas flaring is notoriously unreliable, but AG wasted during flaring is estimated to cost Nigeria US$2.5 billion on a yearly basis. Companies operating in Nigeria harvest natural gas for commercial purposes, however, most prefer to extract it gas from deposits where it is found in isolation as non-associated gas. It is costly to separate commercially viable associated gas from oil, hence gas is flared to increase crude production.\nGas flaring is discouraged by the international community as it contributes to climate change. In fact, in western Europe 99% of associated gas is used or re-injected into the ground. Gas flaring in Nigeria releases large amounts of methane, which has a very high global warming potential. The methane is accompanied by carbon dioxide, of which Nigeria is estimated to have emitted more than 34.38 million tons in 2002, accounting for about 50% of all industrial emissions in the country and 30% of the total CO2 emissions. As flaring in the west has been minimised, in Nigeria it has grown proportionally with oil production. While the international community, the Nigerian government, and the oil corporations seem to agree that gas flaring need to be curtailed, efforts to do so have been slow and largely ineffective.\nGas flares release a variety of potentially poisonous chemicals such as nitrogen dioxides; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compounds like benzene, toluene, xylene, and hydrogen sulfide; as well as carcinogens like benzapyrene and dioxins. Often gas flares are often close to local communities and lack adequate fencing or protection for villagers who may risk nearing the heat of the flare in order to carry out their daily activities. Flares which are often older and inefficient are rarely relocated away from villages and are known to coat the land and communities in the area with soot and damage adjacent vegetation.\nIn November 2005, a judgment by \"the Federal High Court of Nigeria ordered that gas flaring must stop in a Niger Delta community as it violates guaranteed constitutional rights to life and dignity. In a case brought against the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (Shell), Justice C. V. Nwokorie ruled in Benin City that the damaging and wasteful practice of flaring cannot lawfully continue.\"\n\nHuman rights impact\nRepression of protest and government corruption\nOne of the greatest threats facing the people of the Niger River Delta has actually been their own government. The Nigerian government has total control over property rights, and they have the authority to seize any property for use by the oil companies. A majority of every dollar that comes out of the ground in the delta goes to the State and Federal governments.\nAccording to the World Bank, most of Nigeria's oil wealth gets siphoned off by 1% of the population. Corruption in the government is rampant: since 1960 it is estimated that 300 to 400 billion dollars has been stolen by corrupt government officials. The corruption is found at the highest levels as well. For example, a former inspector general of the national police was accused of stealing 52 million dollars. He was sentenced to six years in prison for a lesser charge.\nNigerians have on many occasions engaged in protests against oil-related corruption and environmental concerns in the past but have been met with harsh suppression by government forces. For example, in February 2005 at a protest at Chevron's Escravos oil terminal, soldiers opened fire on the protestors. One man was killed, and 30 others were injured. The soldiers claimed that the protestors were armed, which the protestors denied. Another, more extreme example happened in 1994. The Nigerian military moved into a region called Ogoniland in force. They razed 30 villages, arrested hundreds of protestors, and killed an estimated 2,000 people.\nOne of the protestors they arrested was a man named Ken Saro-Wiwa, a Nigerian TV producer, writer and social activist. In 1990 he founded the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP). Ken wrote and spoke out about the rampant corruption in the Nigerian government, and he condemned Shell and BP. He was arrested by the Nigerian government and imprisoned for 17 months. Then in a show trial he and eight others were condemned to death. He and the others were hung in 1995 and he was buried in an unmarked common grave.\n\nPoverty and chronic underdevelopment\n\nThe people of the delta states have been living in extreme poverty even in the face of great material wealth found in the waters by their homes. In 2006, 70% of the people in the Niger River Delta lived on less than US$1 per day according to Amnesty International. For many people, this meant finding work in a labour market which is in many instances hostile to them. Much of the labour in the past has been imported. To a growing degree, the labour force for the oil companies is coming from Nigeria, but discrimination has been rampant, and for the most part, locals are discriminated against.\nThis leads to a situation where the men in the community have to search for temporary employment. This has two negative effects on the community. First it takes the men out of the community as they go in search of work. The second is the nature of temporary employment sets up unsustainable spending habits, thinking it will be easy to earn more, when in many cases this does not turn out to be the case).\nAs of 1999, the government officials siphoned off all the money generated from oil sales, so the infrastructure suffered, where most of the villages did not have electricity or even running water. They do not have good access to schools or medical clinics. For many, even clean drinking water is difficult to come by. The deterioration of the infrastructure in the delta states is so severe it is even a problem in the more urban areas. One example of was the airport at Port Harcourt. Part of a fence was not properly maintained and in 2005, an Air France flight hit a herd of cattle on the runway. The airport was closed and had not reopened by 2007. Yet in 2007, indicted corrupt leaders were also cheered by the Niger Delta people.\nAs of 2011, the leadership of the Niger Delta region appeared responsible for most of the underdevelopment in the region. There has been large-scale of corruption amongst the elected leaders especially governors, and the leaders have helped sponsor the militant groups in kidnapping and robbing innocent people and sabotaging the efforts by the federal government for infrastructural development.\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "Although the history of oil exploration in Nigeria dates back to 1903, non-commercial quantities of oil were not discovered there until 1953.

It is an adaptation of The Sword of Shannara trilogy of fantasy novels by Terry Brooks. It follows three heroes as they protect an ancient tree to stop the escape of banished demons. The series was filmed in the Auckland Film Studios and on location elsewhere in New Zealand.\nThe first season of The Shannara Chronicles premiered on MTV in the United States on January 5, 2016, and consisted of 10 episodes. MTV originally greenlit a second season in April 2016 and in May 2017, it was announced that the series would relocate to Spike (now Paramount Network).

In December 2013, it was announced that a series based on the books was being produced for MTV and had been given a straight-to-series, 10-episode order. On April 20, 2016, MTV greenlit a second season of The Shannara Chronicles.\nThe series is produced by Dan Farah, Jon Favreau, Miles Millar, Al Gough, Jonathan Liebesman, and author Terry Brooks. Brooks has stated in an interview that he is happy with the way his story has been adapted. Much like the television adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, the series will not be a direct adaptation following the narrative order of the books, but will feature a mix of the books' stories. The first book of the series to be adapted is The Elfstones of Shannara, the second book in the trilogy, with some elements of the other novels being gradually adapted to the show.\n\nCasting\nIn December 2014, it was announced that Manu Bennett would star as Allanon and in January 2015 Ivana Baquero, Austin Butler, Poppy Drayton, Emelia Burns and John Rhys-Davies joined the show. Malese Jow, Vanessa Morgan, Gentry White, Desmond Chiam and Caroline Chikezie joined the cast as series regulars in season two.\n\nFilming\nFilming for the 10-episode first season wrapped in New Zealand at Auckland Film Studios in June 2015, and the first trailer debuted on July 10, 2015. Filming for the second season, which also consists of 10 episodes, began January 31, 2017, in New Zealand.\n\nMusic\nThe opening theme song, \"Until We Go Down\", from the EP \"Up in Flames\", is performed by Ruelle. Other songs featured in the show's first season include \"Midnight\" by Coldplay, \"You Are a Memory\" by Message to Bears, \"Wave\" by Beck and \"Run Boy Run\" by Woodkid.\n\nRelease\nDuring The Shannara Chronicles panel at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2015, a teaser trailer was revealed, giving audiences a first look at the sets and characters. A television version of the trailer was shown during the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nBroadcast\nThe Shannara Chronicles premiered on MTV in the United States on January 5, 2016, with a two-hour series premiere. New episodes were broadcast every Tuesday at 10 pm ET. The third and fourth episodes were released online after the first two episodes aired on January 5, 2016, prior to their original broadcast schedule.\nThe series was simulcast on MTV in Canada. The two-hour pilot also aired on Bell Media sister network CTV on Wednesday, January 6, 2016. The series has also been licensed to a number of different countries, including the United Kingdom (airing on 5STAR), Australia (Syfy) and New Zealand (Sky TV).\n\nCancellation\nOn January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons. Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks. The series was later considered officially concluded.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nThe Shannara Chronicles has received mixed reviews, receiving a 52/100 score on Metacritic, based on 15 reviews and a 54% for season 1 on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"The Shannara Chronicles wears its influences heavily on its sleeve and needs to find surer footing before it can tap its true potential, but it still might suffice for viewers in search of a teen-friendly Game of Thrones.\" The second season received a 100% approval rating based on five reviews.\nNeil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \"So give this reasonably absorbing series a little credit, even though it often seems to be merely reworking various fantasy formulas. It moves quickly and does a nice job of weaving together two story lines involving an elfin world that is threatened when a giant tree, known as the Ellcrys, begins to die.\" Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote: \"Sure, Shannara, which harks back to the golden age of syndicated genre fare, is a standard quest journey in which there are trolls, gnomes, living trees and magic books, and characters say things like, 'If Allanon is here, there are dark days ahead.' But there's conviction in the show's execution.\"\n\nRatings\nSeason 1 (2016)\nSeason 2 (2017)\nAccolades\nThe series was nominated for a Saturn Award for \"Best Fantasy TV Series\" for the 2015\u20132016 season.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Shannara Chronicles at IMDb \nThe Shannara Chronicles at TV Guide"], "Ground_truth": "The Shannara Chronicles is an American fantasy drama television series created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.

The season officially began on June 1, 1971, and lasted until November 30, 1971. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. This season, the first storm, Arlene, developed on July 4, while the last, Laura, dissipated on November 22.\nActivity was steady through most of the season. Hurricane Edith was its strongest system, reaching Category 5 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. It struck Nicaragua at peak intensity, killing dozens, and later hit southern Louisiana. Hurricane Ginger was its longest-lived system, lasting 27 days from early September to early October, setting a record for the longest known duration of a North Atlantic tropical cyclone (not surpassed until 2003). Ginger moved ashore in North Carolina, producing heavy rains and damaging winds. An unnamed storm in August attained hurricane status further north than any other Atlantic hurricane on record. On September 11-12, there were five active Atlantic tropical cyclones at one time. Despite the activity, damage in the United States totaled about $235 million (1971 USD, $1.77 billion 2024 USD), which National Hurricane Center forecaster Paul Hebert noted was \"pretty small considering we had five storms in a row strike the U.S.\" Most of the damage came from Tropical Storm Doria, which affected much of the East Coast of the United States. Hurricane Fern struck Texas after executing an unusual track, dropping heavy rainfall and producing flooding.\n\nSystems\nTropical Storm Arlene\nThe origins of Arlene were from a cold front that exited the East Coast of the United States on July 2 and stalled offshore. A frontal wave developed the next day, steadily developing due to thermal instability. On July 4, the system organized into a tropical depression about 120 mi (195 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. While in its formative stages, it dropped rainfall along the coast of the Carolinas, peaking at 4.11 in (104 mm) in Pinopolis, South Carolina. The depression tracked northeastward due to a ridge over New England, and the cyclone passed just southeast of the Outer Banks. After a Hurricane Hunters plane observed gale-force winds, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene late on July 5; in the post-season summary, meteorologist Neil Frank noted, \"the surprising element in the development of Arlene was the rapidity of the transformation process.\"\nUpon being named, Arlene continued northeastward, possessing a circular mass of convection with spiral rainbands. Late on July 6, the storm attained peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), based on a ship report. It weakened thereafter, and Arlene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on July 7 just south of Newfoundland. The cyclone last observed early the following day. The storm capsized a boat in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and the crew of 12 was rescued.\n\nUnnamed hurricane\nA hybrid-type depression formed east of Bermuda on July 29. It moved rapidly southwestward before turning to a northwest drift. On August 3, it was classified as a tropical depression, and the next day the system passed near Bermuda. The depression accelerated to the northeast, strengthening into a tropical storm on August 5. It intensified further due to baroclinity, or enhanced instability through different levels of the atmosphere caused by temperature and moisture gradients. On August 6, a drilling rig about 230 mi (370 km) southeast of Newfoundland recorded sustained winds of 90 mph (140 km/h) with gusts to 126 mph (204 km/h) at an altitude of 325 ft (99 m); this suggested the storm attained hurricane status at 46\u00b0 North, which is the northernmost location for a tropical storm to intensify into a hurricane.\nDespite the intensity, the cyclone was not purely tropical; although the radius of maximum winds was only 35 mi (56 km), the thermal structure did not resemble a tropical cyclone, and there was no precipitation or convection near the center. It continued northeastward and dissipated on August 7 to the southwest of Greenland. It was not named operationally, but it was later added to the Atlantic hurricane database.\n\nHurricane Beth\nOn August 9, an upper-level low developed off the coast of Florida, and the next day spawned a tropical depression. The newly developed cyclone tracked slowly northeastward, eventually encountering conditions favorable for development. On August 14, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beth off the coast of North Carolina, and it quickly strengthened into a hurricane by August 15. After reaching peak winds of 85 mph (137 km/h) off the coast of Cape Cod, Beth slightly weakened and later moved ashore near Copper Lake, Nova Scotia. Shortly thereafter, Beth was swept up by a nearby cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.\nThe hurricane left extensive damage in its wake, especially to crops and infrastructure. Halifax International Airport reported 10.49 in (266 mm) of rainfall in a 30\u2011hour span, which caused widespread flooding. Several bridges in the region were washed out, while railways were covered by water, forcing trains to suspend their operation. Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated up to $5.1 million (1971 USD, $38.4 million 2024 USD). One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rainfall.\n\nTropical Depression Seven\nOn August 12, a tropical depression developed southwest of Fort Myers, Florida. It quickly moved ashore, reaching Lake Okeechobee before looping to the northwest. While moving across the state, it dropped heavy rainfall of around 10 in (250 mm) along the west coast. In Pinellas Park, the heavy rains led to flash flooding that forced 200 families from their house, including one that required evacuation from a helicopter. Damage in the region was estimated at $250,000 (1971 USD, $1.88 million 2024 USD).\nThe depression emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 15 near Tampa, and later turned to the northeast ahead of an upper-level low. On August 16, it intensified as it moved ashore near Cedar Key, where hurricane-force wind gusts were briefly observed. The depression dissipated on August 17 over South Carolina, although in that state it produced its heaviest rainfall, totaling 14.11 in (358 mm) in Sullivan's Island. In nearby Savannah, Georgia, the rainfall forced about 100 families from their houses in low-lying areas. The remnants continued northeastward through the Mid-Atlantic States and New England, crossing into Canada on August 20.\n\nTropical Storm Chloe\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 13, moving westward for several days before organizing into a tropical depression on August 18 about 460 mi (740 km) east of Barbados. It quickly moved through the Lesser Antilles, where it produced wind gusts up to 58 mph (93 km/h). The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall up to 6 in (150 mm) on Barbados and Martinique. After entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chloe on August 20. About 18 hours after attaining tropical storm status, Chloe quickly strengthened to peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) about 215 mi (345 km) south of the Mona Passage, as reported by reconnaissance aircraft.\nAfter reaching peak intensity, Chloe began weakening as it turned to the west-southwest, and late on August 22, it was downgraded to a tropical depression as a weakening ridge to its north cut off the low-level inflow. For several days it continued generally westward, gradually losing organization. While passing south of Jamaica, the storm prompted the evacuation of the SS Hope, a hospital ship, at Kingston. On August 25, Chloe moved ashore in Belize as a weak tropical depression, and dissipated shortly thereafter without ever having caused significant damage or deaths. The remnants of Chloe later spawned Hurricane Lily in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nTropical Storm Doria\nTropical Storm Doria, the costliest storm of the season, developed from a tropical wave on August 20 to the east of the Lesser Antilles, and after five days without development attained tropical storm status to the east of Florida. Doria turned to the north, and reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) as it was making landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina. It turned to the northeast, and moved through the Mid-Atlantic and New England as a tropical storm before becoming an extratropical storm over Maine on August 29.\nIn North Carolina, Doria produced moderate rainfall, resulting in localized flooding and damage. The storm spawned a tornado near Norfolk, Virginia, damaging twelve houses and downing hundreds of trees. Tropical Storm Doria dropped heavy precipitation in New Jersey, peaking at 10.29 in (261 mm) in Little Falls. The rainfall led to record-breaking river levels and flooding in several houses, resulting in damage to dozens of houses across the state. Moderate damage and rainfall continued along its path into New England and southeastern Canada. In all, Tropical Storm Doria caused seven deaths and $147.6 million (1971 USD, $1.11 billion 2024 USD).\n\nHurricane Fern\nHurricane Fern was the first of four tropical systems to develop in association with an extended surface trough across the Gulf of Mexico into the open Atlantic, along with Ginger, Heidi, and a strong tropical depression. Fern developed on September 3 in the central Gulf of Mexico. It moved over southern Louisiana the next day, but due to increased ridging to the north the depression moved southwestward back over water. On September 7, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fern; it is rare for a tropical depression to move over land in the continental United States (excluding Florida) and later attain tropical storm status. Fern later turned to the northwest, intensifying into a hurricane on September 8. It quickly reached peak winds of 90 mph (140 km/h), but later weakened as it curved to the southwest, moving ashore on September 10 between Freeport and Matagorda, Texas as a tropical storm. Fern dissipated on September 13 over northeastern Mexico.\nThe precursor of Fern dropped rainfall up to 5 in (130 mm) of rainfall across South Florida, while totals of up to 10 in (250 mm) were reported in southeastern Louisiana where it made its first landfall. As it struck Texas, Fern produced strong winds up to 86 mph (138 km/h), along with 5 to 6 ft (1.5 to 1.8 m) storm tides and heavy rainfall; the highest precipitation total was 26.0 in (660 mm) in Beeville. The heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding that isolated numerous small towns in the southeastern portion of the state, damaging 7,500 buildings. In all, Fern left two indirect deaths and moderate damage totaling $30.2 million (1971 USD, $220 million 2024 USD).\n\nHurricane Edith\nHurricane Edith, the strongest storm of the season, developed from a tropical wave on September 5 to the east of the southern Lesser Antilles. It moved quickly across the southern Caribbean Sea, intensifying into a hurricane just off the north coast of South America. Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. After moving across the Gulf of Mexico, a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on September 16. Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18.\nThe hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba. Striking northeastern Central America as a Category 5 hurricane, Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people. In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage. Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm. One tornado, rated F3 on the Fujita Scale, damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge. The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida. Damage in the United States totaled $25 million (1971 USD, $188 million 2024 USD).\n\nHurricane Ginger\nHurricane Ginger was thought to be the longest lasting Atlantic hurricane on record until 2003, when the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane was retroactively found to have lasted longer. The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the season, Ginger spent 27.25 days as a tropical cyclone, and lasted from September 6 to October 3. The storm developed in a large region of convection across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic, and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally east- or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). On September 14 Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September 23; there, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.\nWhile over the western Atlantic Ocean, Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury, which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands. The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of Ginger, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; Ginger was the last seeding done by the project. Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September 30 as a minimal hurricane, lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region. Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left heavy crop damage, with 3 million bushels of corn and 1 million bushels of soybean lost. Damage in the state was estimated at $10 million (1971 USD, $75.2 million 2024 USD). Further north, moderate rainfall and winds spread through the Mid-Atlantic states, although no significant damage was reported outside of North Carolina.\n\nTropical Storm Heidi\nTropical Storm Heidi was the last of the four tropical systems to develop from the extended surface trough of low pressure, forming on September 11 northeast of the Bahamas and intensifying into a tropical storm the next day. After initially moving to the northwest, Heidi curved northeastward and attained its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 14 off the coast of Virginia. The storm failed to become a well-organized system, and it gradually weakened while accelerating north-northeastward. On September 15, shortly after Heidi moved ashore in Maine, it was absorbed by a broad extratropical cyclone over the northern Appalachians.\nHeidi did not directly cause any fatalities or severe damage. However, the larger extratropical storm drew in moisture from Heidi, producing rainfall from North Carolina through northern New England, including a peak of 9.38 in (238 mm) in southeastern Pennsylvania. The heavy rains triggered extensive flooding that caused over a dozen fatalities and left thousands of residents homeless in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In Chester, Pennsylvania a stone dam collapsed, forcing hundreds of families to evacuate and damaging homes, businesses, roads, and bridges. Governor Milton Shapp declared a state of emergency in several Pennsylvania counties following the floods.\n\nHurricane Irene\nA tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on September 11 about 800 mi (1300 km) east of the Windward Islands. The cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude, passing through the southern Windward Islands and later over northern South America. In the southwest Caribbean Sea, it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane. Irene made landfall on southeastern Nicaragua on September 19, and maintained its circulation as it crossed the low-lying terrain of the country. Restrengthening after reaching the Pacific, Irene was renamed Hurricane Olivia, which ultimately attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) before weakening and dissipating over northwestern Mexico.\nIn the Atlantic, Irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96 homes were destroyed, and 1,200 people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing three people in Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1 million (1971 USD, $7.52 million 2024 USD) in damage to the banana crop. The hurricane was the first actively tracked tropical cyclone that moved into the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTropical Storm Janice\nThe origins of Janice were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 18. It developed into a tropical depression on September 21 about 1050 mi (1700 km) west-southwest of Cape Verde, which was the easternmost formation of the named storms this season. The next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Janice, and quickly reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h). The storm never became well-organized, with its peak winds located east of the broad center. Despite being in a climatologically favored region for further development, Janice weakened due to increased wind shear from Hurricane Ginger. The circulation became elongated and separated from the convection, and on September 24 the storm weakened to a tropical depression. Later that day Janice dissipated just northeast of the Lesser Antilles as it was absorbed by Ginger. Around that time, it produced rainfall in the northeastern Caribbean, reaching 4 in (100 mm) on Saint Kitts; no damage or fatalities were reported.\n\nTropical Storm Kristy\nThe interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level trough led to the development of a tropical depression on October 18, about 685 mi (1100 km) northeast of Puerto Rico. It moved quickly north-northeastward, followed by a curve to the northeast. On October 20, a ship reported winds of 45 mph (72 km/h), indicating the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy. As it reached this strength, an approaching cold front produced cooler, drier air over the storm. Kristy intensified slightly further to peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) before becoming indistinguishable from the cold front. By October 21 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating near the Azores.\n\nTropical Storm Laura\nThe final storm of the season, Laura, formed on November 12 in the western Caribbean Sea, and reached winds of 70 mph (120 km/h) as it approached western Cuba. Across the island, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 32.5 in (830 mm). The resulting flooding killed one person and caused crop damage, and also forced 26,000 people to evacuate their homes. Initially, Laura was forecast to move across the island and impact the southern United States, but it executed a small loop and turned to the southwest. The storm moved ashore on Belize, one of only four November storms to affect the country. Little impact occurred during Laura's final landfall, and it dissipated on November 22 over central Guatemala.\n\nOther systems\nIn addition to the named storms and otherwise notable cyclones, there were several weak depressions during the season. After a June devoid of activity, three tropical depressions developed within the first ten days of July. The first became Tropical Storm Arlene on July 4, and the second formed off the coast of Louisiana on July 6. Tropical Depression Two moved westward due to a ridge to its northeast, and it struck just west of the Texas-Louisiana border before dissipating on July 8. Its precursor dropped 3.90 in (99 mm) near Carrabelle, Florida, but much less along its path. Just two days later, another tropical depression formed in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, quickly moving ashore in southern Texas before dissipating on July 11; it dropped light rainfall along its path.\nIn August, there were two tropical depressions, in addition to the named storms and the notable Tropical Depression Seven. The first, Tropical Depression Five, developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on August 6. It made landfall in Louisiana three days later, eventually dissipating over Mississippi. The other, designated Tropical Depression Ten, formed over the Bahamas on August 28. It moved westward, crossing Florida and the Gulf of Mexico before dissipating over southeastern Louisiana on September 1. The depression dropped moderate rainfall along the Gulf Coast, peaking at 6.82 in (173 mm) at Gulf Shores, Alabama.\nThere were three non-developing tropical depressions in September, the first of which just off the coast of Africa on September 3. It moved west-northwestward, passing near Cape Verde before dissipating on September 8. The next, Tropical Depression Fifteen, originated on September 8 east of Florida from the same trough that also spawned Fern, Ginger, and Heidi. It initially moved northward before curving to the west, making landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina border on September 11 before dissipating the following day. The other, Tropical Depression Sixteen, developed off the coast of Africa on September 10, moving westward before dissipating on September 14.\nThe final non-developing tropical depression of the season formed on October 6 in the western Caribbean Sea. It crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula the next day, dropping heavy rainfall up to 9.09 in (231 mm). The depression turned to the northeast due to an approaching upper-level trough, and it transitioned into a frontal wave on October 10. As the trough advanced ahead of the storm, a ridge built across the southeast United States, causing the cyclone to turn northward and parallel the west coast of Florida. It regained tropical characteristics before moving ashore near Apalachicola and dissipating on October 14.\n\nStorm names\nThe following list of names was used for named tropical storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 1971. This is the same list used in the 1967 season, with the exception of Beth, which replaced Beulah. Storms were named Beth, Kristy, and Laura for the first time in 1971. No names were retired following the season; however, an overhaul of the naming system in 1979 to include male names resulted in this list being discarded.\n\nSeason effects\nThis is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1971 USD.\n\nSee also\n1971 Pacific hurricane season\n1971 Pacific typhoon season\n1971 North Indian Ocean cyclone season\nAustralian region cyclone seasons: 1970\u201371 1971\u201372\nSouth Pacific cyclone seasons: 1970\u201371 1971\u201372\nSouth-West Indian Ocean cyclone seasons: 1970\u201371 1971\u201372\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMonthly Weather Review\nHPC rainfall pages for 1971 tropical cyclones"], "Ground_truth": "Hurricane Edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season.

The screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith is a modernization of William Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the Shrew, retold in a late-1990s American high school setting. The film follows new student Cameron James (Gordon-Levitt) who is smitten with Bianca Stratford (Oleynik) and attempts to get bad boy Patrick Verona (Ledger) to date her antisocial sister Kat (Stiles) in order to get around her father's strict rules on dating. Named after a poem Kat writes about her romance with Patrick, the film was mostly shot in the Seattle metropolitan area, with many scenes filmed at Stadium High School in Tacoma, Washington.\nReleased on March 31, 1999, 10 Things I Hate About You grossed over $60 million and received generally positive reviews from critics. It provided breakthrough roles for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-oriented awards. The film has since developed a cult following and is considered a classic in the teen film genre. Ten years later, it was adapted into a television reboot, which ran for 20 episodes and featured Larry Miller reprising his role as Walter Stratford.\n\nPlot\nCameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, immediately becomes smitten with beautiful and popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that she is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective single father Walter, an obstetrician worried about teenage pregnancy, does not allow her or her shrewish older sister Kat, a senior, to date. Kat is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but Walter wants her to stay close to home and attend his alma mater, the University of Washington. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter relents and declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude will greatly complicate it.\nWhen Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and suggests he find someone willing to date Kat so that she can freely date Joey. He selects Australian \"bad boy\" Patrick Verona, who initially frightens him with his attitude. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take Kat out, believing that it will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat initially rebuffs his first few advances. After Michael and Cameron assist him by probing Bianca for information on Kat's preferences, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to tag along, greatly upsetting Walter.\nAt the party, Kat becomes upset upon seeing Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting intoxicated. Patrick attends to her, and she starts to open up to him, expressing her interest in forming a band. When Kat attempts to kiss him, Patrick pulls away, causing her to depart, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca upsets Cameron by ignoring him for Joey, but soon realizes that Joey is indeed shallow and self-absorbed. When she asks Cameron to drive her home, he admits his feelings for her are indeed genuine and her treatment of him has frustrated him, and she reconciliatorily kisses him in response.\nJoey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the prom so he can take Bianca. He initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Although Kat is still angry with Patrick, he eventually wins her over by serenading her, accompanied by the Padua High School marching band, with a performance of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" by Frankie Valli, and she returns the favor by assisting him in sneaking out of detention. Their subsequent date turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious when Patrick insists that she accompany him to the prom, which she adamantly opposes.\nIrritated at not being asked to the prom by Cameron, Bianca accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter declines to allow it unless Kat accompanies her. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sexual intercourse with him, later regretting it. After Joey dumped her, she vowed against doing anything out of peer pressure. Bianca insists that she can decide her own life, so Kat agrees to attend the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey. At the prom, Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sexual intercourse with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave, heartbroken. Joey then shoves Michael and punches Cameron, but Bianca then assaults him for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.\nThe following day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Comfortable that Kat can handle herself, Walter permits her to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were tasked to write their own versions of William Shakespeare's Sonnet 141, Kat reads aloud a poem she composed, entitled \"10 Things I Hate About You\", revealing that she still loves and cares for Patrick. He surprises her with a Fender Stratocaster that he bought with the money Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nGeoff Andrew from Time Out praised the film's leads, writing, \"Stiles grows into her character, and Ledger is effortlessly charming.\" Brad Laidman of Film Threat said the film was \"pure of heart and perfectly executed.\" Ron Wells, also of Film Threat, wrote, \"Of all the teen films released this year, this one is, by far, the best.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying that he \"liked the movie's spirit, the actors and some of the scenes. The music, much of it by the band Letters to Cleo, is subtle and inventive while still cheerful. The movie almost but not quite achieves liftoff against the gravitational pull of the tired story formula.\" Entertainment Weekly put the film 49th on its list of Best High School Movies.\n\nAccolades\n10 Things I Hate About You provided breakthrough roles for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt.

Reviewer S. Peeples of AllMusic rated it 3 stars out of 5, calling it \"one of the best modern rock soundtracks of the spring 1999 season\".\n\nCertifications\nAdaptations\nIn June 1999, the Scholastic Corporation published a novelization of the story, adapted by David Levithan. The story is retold as it is in the film, with each chapter written from the point of view of either Bianca, Cameron, Kat, Patrick, or Michael.\nIn October 2008, ABC Family ordered a pilot episode of 10 Things I Hate About You, a half-hour, single-camera comedy series based on the film.

Known as \"the Voice\", she is one of the most awarded entertainers of all time, having been inducted into numerous halls of fame. Houston's crossover appeal on the popular music charts and her performances influenced the breaking down of gender and racial barriers, as well as popular culture. She has been recognized for her vocal delivery, distinctive timbre, and for popularizing the use of gospel singing techniques in pop music. In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Houston second on their list of the greatest singers of all time. She has sold over 220 million records worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling music artists in history. Houston also enhanced her popularity by producing and starring in multicultural movies. Her life and career have been the subject of multiple documentaries and television specials.\nHouston began singing at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey, as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school. She was one of the first black women to appear on the cover of Seventeen after becoming a teen model in 1981. With the guidance of Arista Records chairman Clive Davis, Houston signed to the label at age 19. Her first two studio albums, Whitney Houston (1985) and Whitney (1987), both peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and are among the best-selling albums of all time. She is the only artist to have seven consecutive number-one singles on Billboard Hot 100 since 1988. Her third studio album, I'm Your Baby Tonight (1990), yielded two US number-one singles, the title track and \"All the Man That I Need\". Houston's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl XXV in 1991 received widespread media coverage.\nHouston made her acting debut with the romantic thriller film The Bodyguard (1992), which despite its mixed reviews became the tenth highest-grossing film to that date. Its soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and remains the bestselling soundtrack album of all time. The lead single \"I Will Always Love You\" won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became the best-selling female single in history. Houston went on to star and record soundtracks for the films Waiting to Exhale (1995) and The Preacher's Wife (1996). The former soundtrack scored her 11th Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\", while the latter, produced by Houston herself, became the bestselling gospel album of all time. In 1998, Houston released her first studio album in eight years, My Love Is Your Love, which critics considered one of her best albums. As a film producer, she produced hit series such as The Princess Diaries, The Cheetah Girls and movies such as Cinderella (1997) and Sparkle (2012).\nFollowing the success, she renewed her contract with Arista Records for $100 million in 2001, one of the biggest recording deals of all time. However, her personal problems began to overshadow her music career. Her 2002 studio album, Just Whitney, received mixed reviews, while her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown received widespread media coverage. After divorcing Brown, Houston returned to the top of the Billboard 200 chart with her final studio album, I Look to You (2009). In February 2012, Houston accidentally drowned in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards, which took place the day following her death, and was covered internationally along with her memorial service. Coverage of Houston's death was ranked as the most memorable entertainment event in television history, according to a study by Sony Electronics and the Nielsen Television Research Company. Her assets amounted to $250 million, earned over a 25-year career.\n\nEarly life and family\nWhitney Elizabeth Houston was born on August 9, 1963, at Presbyterian Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, to Emily \"Cissy\" (n\u00e9e Drinkard) and John Russell Houston Jr. Cissy is a Grammy-winning gospel and soul singer who was a member of The Drinkard Singers and the founder of The Sweet Inspirations before becoming a solo artist. John was a former Army serviceman who later became an administrator under the Newark mayor. Houston was given the nickname \"Nippy\" by her father.\nHouston's parents were both African-American. On her mother's side, Houston was alleged to have partial Dutch and Native American ancestry. Through Cissy, Houston was a cousin of singers Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick as well as a distant cousin of opera singer Leontyne Price. Aretha Franklin became an \"honorary aunt\" while Darlene Love was Houston's godmother. Through her father, her great-great-grandfather Jeremiah Burke Sanderson was an American abolitionist and advocate for the civil and educational rights of black Americans during the mid-19th century. Houston had three older brothers, paternal half-brother John III, maternal half-brother  Gary, a former basketball player and singer, and Michael.\nThe family later relocated to a suburban area of East Orange three years following the Newark race riots of 1967. Houston was raised in the Baptist faith by her parents and joined the church choir of the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark at age five where she also learned to play piano. She later recalled being exposed to the Pentecostal church nearby as well. Houston made her solo performance debut at New Hope singing the hymn \"Guide Me O Thou Great Jehovah\" at age 12. When Houston became a teenager, she told her mother that she wanted to pursue a career in music. Throughout her teenage years, she would be taught how to sing by Cissy. Along with her mother, cousins and Franklin, Houston was influenced by singers such as Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, and Roberta Flack. Houston attended Franklin Elementary School (now Whitney E. Houston Academy of Creative and Performing Arts) before transferring to Mount Saint Dominic Academy by sixth grade.\n\nCareer\n1978\u20131984: Career beginnings\nHouston's professional career began shortly after she placed second in a statewide talent showcase in 1977 after she joined her mother's band as a backing singer while Cissy performed on the NYC cabaret club circuit. On February 18, 1978, a fourteen-year-old Houston made her non-church performance debut at Manhattan's Town Hall singing the Broadway standard \"Tomorrow\" from the musical Annie, receiving her first standing ovation. That same year, she began a career as a session singer backing up her mother and producer Michael Zager, before being assigned to back up artists such as Lou Rawls and Chaka Khan. It was with Zager where Houston recorded lead vocals alongside her mother on the song, \"Life's a Party\", featured on the album of the same name.\nHouston became a fashion model in 1980 after she was discovered by a photographer who filmed her following a benefit concert for the United Negro College Fund at Carnegie Hall. She became one of the first black women to appear on the cover of a fashion magazine when she appeared on the cover of Seventeen the following year. With her looks and girl-next-door charm, Houston became one of the most sought-after teen models in the country, later appearing in fashion spreads for Glamour, Cosmopolitan and Young Miss. During that period, Houston continued her music career, recording demos of gospel recordings with producer Steven Abdul Khan Brown. Houston's vocal talent made her sought after for recording deals by the likes of Michael Zager and Luther Vandross. The offers, however, were turned down by her mother because she wanted Houston to finish school. In September 1981, she signed with Tara Productions, under the advice of her cousin Dionne, and hired Gene Harvey as her manager, with co-managers Daniel Gittelman and Seymour Flics, also working closely with Houston.\nDuring 1982, Houston would audition for CBS Records and Elektra Records. That year, she was assigned lead vocals on the song \"Memories\" by the band Material, later released on their 1982 album, One Down. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called her contribution \"one of the most gorgeous ballads you've ever heard\". Around this time, another ballad, \"Eternal Love\", co-written by Paul Jabara, would be placed on Jabara's album, Paul Jabara & Friends, which would be released in March 1983. By the end of 1982, Houston was in talks of securing a deal with Elektra Records through the label's president, Bruce Lundvall, who offered her a contract that December. In the late winter of 1983, Gerry Griffith, an A&R representative for Arista Records, saw Houston performing with her mother at the Seventh Avenue South nightclub in Manhattan. Griffith convinced Arista head Clive Davis to make time to see her perform at another nightclub called Sweetwaters the following week. Davis was impressed and immediately offered a worldwide record deal, which Houston eventually signed on April 10, 1983; since she was only nineteen, her parents also signed for her. Two weeks later, on April 29, Houston performed on The Merv Griffin Show, after an introduction from Davis. Her performance later aired on June 23. She performed \"Home\", a song from the musical The Wiz.\nHouston did not begin work on an album immediately. The label wanted to make sure no other label signed her away and Davis wanted to ensure he had the right material and producers for her debut album. Some producers passed on the project because of prior commitments. Houston first recorded a duet with Teddy Pendergrass, \"Hold Me\", which appeared on his gold album, Love Language. The single was released in 1984 and gave Houston her first taste of success, becoming a top ten hit on the R&B and adult contemporary charts. It would also appear on her debut album in 1985. She also appeared as a duet vocalist and background singer on Jermaine Jackson's Dynamite and Kashif's Send Me Your Love albums. During this early period, Houston continued to model, appeared in a commercial for the Canada Dry soft drink, and also began singing commercial jingles, including one for the restaurant brand, Steak & Ale.\n\n1985\u20131986: Whitney Houston and rise to international prominence\nAfter nearly two years of sessions, Whitney Houston was released on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1985. Co-produced by Kashif, Jermaine Jackson, Michael Masser and Narada Michael Walden, the album would spend more than three years on the Billboard 200 and shot up to No. 1 on the chart in March 1986, over a year after its release, where it would stay for fourteen weeks. The album would hit number one or hit the top five in more than ten other countries. Certified Diamond in the United States for sales of 14 million copies, the album has reportedly sold 25 million copies worldwide. Rolling Stone magazine praised Houston, calling her \"one of the most exciting new voices in years\" while The New York Times called the album \"an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an exceptional vocal talent\".\nThe album launched seven singles in various countries, including four alone in the United States. The album spawned four top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including the top five crossover hit, \"You Give Good Love\", and three consecutive number one singles, \"Saving All My Love for You\", \"How Will I Know\" and \"Greatest Love of All\". This feat made Houston the first solo female recording artist to launch three number one singles off a single album. Outside the US, \"Saving All My Love for You\" hit number one in the UK and Ireland, \"How Will I Know\" reached number one in Canada, and \"Greatest Love of All\" topped the charts in Australia. In addition, the album's international success was further buoyed by the ballad \"All at Once\", which hit the top five in selected European countries. Another song, \"Thinking About You\", became a top ten single on the R&B chart.\nThe album would receive four Grammy Award nominations, including three at the 1986 ceremony, including Album of the Year, winning one in the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance category for \"Saving All My Love for You\". A controversy arose after Houston was deemed ineligible for entry for a nomination for Best New Artist. Despite an angry letter from Clive Davis, the committee defended the decision, noting Houston's previous chart duet with Teddy Pendergrass. Houston received more awards from her work on the album including 14 Billboard Awards, including \"Top Pop Artist\" and \"Top Pop Album\", the first album by a female artist to receive that distinction, and an NAACP Image Award. Houston's music video for \"How Will I Know\" won her an MTV Video Music Award. Houston's performance of \"Saving All My Love for You\" at the 1986 Grammys later resulted in Houston winning an Emmy Award. Houston would also receive seven American Music Awards, including five alone in 1987.\nHouston first supported the album by being an opening act for singer Jeffrey Osborne before moving on to open for Luther Vandross. By October 1985, Houston had become a solo headliner, later opening at Carnegie Hall. Houston embarked on her first world tour, The Greatest Love World Tour, in July 1986. Houston toured for 50 dates up until the end of the year. The album's success was attributed to Houston's performances on late night talk shows, something that was usually not accessible to emerging black acts. Though Houston's early music video clips for \"You Give Good Love\" and \"Saving All My Love for You\" found heavy airplay on stations such as BET and VH1, the singer and Arista struggled to submit these videos to MTV. At that time, the channel received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by artists of color while favoring predominantly white acts. In 2001, Houston explained in an interview with the channel how it rejected \"You Give Good Love\" because it was a \"very kind of R&B song\". Following the release of \"Saving All My Love for You\", MTV agreed to play its video clip on light rotation because, Houston said, the song \"hit so hard and exploded so heavy\" that they \"had no choice but to play it.\"\nIn December 1985, Arista submitted the video to \"How Will I Know\", which immediately gained heavy rotation and introduced Houston to the young MTV audience. Though other artists such as Donna Summer and Tina Turner had enjoyed heavy rotation on the channel prior to Houston's entrance, black female artists were still \"woefully underrepresented on MTV's playlist\". According to author Ann Kaplan, in her book, Rocking Around the Clock: Television, Postmodernism and Consumer Culture, \"until the recent advent of Whitney Houston, Tina Turner was the only female Black singer featured regularly, and even so, her videos are far and few between.\" Houston was credited for breaking barriers for black female artists on the channel resulting in videos by Janet Jackson, Jody Watley and Tracy Chapman to be immediately accepted to the channel's playlist. Houston's success also made it possible for other African American female artists to break through on pop radio following the fallout of disco, opening doors for Jackson and Anita Baker among others. Houston's debut album is listed as one of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Definitive 200 list. Houston's grand entrance into the music industry is considered one of the 25 musical milestones of the last 25 years, according to USA Today.\n\n1987\u20131989: Whitney and social activism\nIn June 1987, Houston's second album, Whitney, was released. Produced majorly by Narada Michael Walden, the album also featured productions from past collaborators Michael Masser and Kashif, with the sole new producer, Jellybean Benitez, contributing the hit dance song, \"Love Will Save the Day\". Critics complained that the material was too similar to her previous album. Rolling Stone said, \"the narrow channel through which this talent has been directed is frustrating\". The album nonetheless enjoyed commercial success. Houston became the first woman in music history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and the first artist ever to enter number one in the US and UK, while also hitting number one or top ten in dozens of other countries around the world. Houston was the first female solo artist to produce two consecutive albums that stayed at number one on the Billboard 200 for ten or more weeks as well as the first female artist to accumulate more than ten weeks atop the Billboard 200 following its historic debut at number one.\nThe album's first single, \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\", released a month earlier in May, was also a massive hit worldwide, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the singles chart in 17 countries, including Australia, West Germany and the UK. To date, the single has sold over 14 million copies worldwide. Following that single was three more singles, \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\", \"So Emotional\" and \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\", all of which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100. With this feat, Houston became the first recording artist in history to earn seven consecutive number one hits, besting the previous record of six, held by the Beatles and the Bee Gees. Houston remains the only artist to ever accomplish this feat as of 2024. In addition, Houston also became the first female artist to generate four number one singles off one album. Whitney has been certified Diamond in the US for shipments of over ten million copies and has sold a total of 20 million copies worldwide.\nThe album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 1988 ceremony. Houston would eventually win her second Grammy that year in the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance category for \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\". In addition, Houston would win four American Music Awards for her work on the album. She also won her first Soul Train Music Award when the album won for best R&B album by a female artist. In addition, the album also won Houston six Billboard Awards.\nJust a month after the album's release, Houston launched her second world tour, the Moment of Truth World Tour at Tampa Stadium in July 1987. The tour eventually ended its North American leg as one of the ten highest-grossing concert tours of the year and the highest-grossing of the year by a female performer, topping tours by both Madonna and Tina Turner. Houston would eventually toured 150 dates throughout the nearly two-year tour, including eight sold out dates at London's Wembley Arena. The singer's unprecedented successes helped her to earn notices on Forbes magazine. In 1987, she was ranked the eighth highest-ranking entertainer of the year on its Forbes 40 list, earning $43 million in that year alone. The highest-earning musician and highest black female entertainer on the list, she was only the third highest after Bill Cosby and Eddie Murphy. In 1988, she ranked 17th.\nHouston was a supporter of Nelson Mandela and the anti-apartheid movement. During her modeling days, she refused to work with agencies who did business with the then-apartheid South Africa. On June 11, 1988, during the European leg of her tour, Houston joined other musicians to perform a set at Wembley Stadium in London to celebrate a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday. Over 72,000 people attended Wembley Stadium and over a billion people tuned in worldwide as the rock concert raised over $1 million for charities while bringing awareness to apartheid. Houston then flew back to the US for a concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City in August. The show was a benefit concert that raised a quarter of a million dollars for the United Negro College Fund. In the same year, she recorded a song for NBC's coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics, \"One Moment in Time\", which became a Top 5 hit in the US, while reaching number one in the UK and Germany. The song later won Houston and her producer Narada Michael Walden a Sports Emmy Award. In January 1989, Houston formed The Whitney Houston Foundation For Children, a nonprofit organization that has raised funds for the needs of children around the world. The organization cares for homelessness, children with cancer or AIDS and other issues of self-empowerment. The organization now functions under the name, the Whitney E. Houston Legacy Foundation.\n\n1990\u20131991: I'm Your Baby Tonight and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"\nWith the success of her first two albums, Houston became an international crossover superstar, appealing to all demographics. However, some black critics believed she was \"selling out\". They felt her singing on record lacked the soul that was present during her live concerts. At the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards, when Houston's name was called out for a nomination, a few in the audience jeered. Houston defended herself against the criticism, stating, \"If you're gonna have a long career, there's a certain way to do it and I did it that way. I'm not ashamed of it.\"\nHouston took a more urban direction with her third studio album, I'm Your Baby Tonight, released in November 1990. The first album in which she served as executive producer and exerted creative control for the first time in her career, Houston chose mostly black producers such as the team of L.A. Reid and Babyface, as well as Luther Vandross and Stevie Wonder, while maintaining Narada Michael Walden as one of the main producers. The album showed Houston's versatility on a new batch of tough rhythmic grooves, soulful ballads and uptempo dance tracks. Reviews were mixed. Rolling Stone felt it was her \"best and most integrated album\", while Entertainment Weekly, at the time thought Houston's shift towards an urban direction was \"superficial\".\nReaching number three on the Billboard 200, the album stayed inside the top ten for 22 weeks, becoming the tenth best-selling album of 1991. The album also became Houston's second number one album on the Top R&B Albums chart, staying there for eight consecutive weeks. The album launched six singles, three of which - \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\", \"All the Man That I Need\" and \"Miracle\", made the top ten, with the former two topping the Billboard Hot 100. That feat helped Houston become the first female solo artist to have multiple number one singles off three or more albums. The fourth single, \"My Name Is Not Susan\", peaked inside the top 20, while the latter two - \"I Belong to You\" and \"We Didn't Know\", a duet with Wonder, was only issued to R&B stations. It became Houston's third album to yield five or more top ten singles on the R&B chart. The album would be certified four times platinum in the US for sales of four million copies, while shipping 10 million copies worldwide. The album would eventually win Houston eight Billboard awards, including four trophies at the actual Billboard Music Awards in December 1991, including Top R&B Artist. Three of the songs, including \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" and \"All the Man That I Need\", received Grammy nominations. The remix to \"My Name Is Not Susan\", with British rapper Monie Love, marked one of the first instances of a remix of a pop song to feature a rapper. A bonus track from the album's Japanese edition, \"Higher Love\", was remixed by Norwegian DJ and record producer Kygo and released posthumously in 2019 to commercial success. It topped the US Dance Club Songs chart and peaked at number two in the UK, becoming Houston's highest-charting single in the country since 1999.\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War, on January 27, 1991, Houston performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", the US national anthem, at Super Bowl XXV at Tampa Stadium. Houston's vocals were pre-recorded, prompting criticism. Dan Klores, a spokesman for Houston, said: \"This is not a Milli Vanilli thing. She sang live, but the microphone was turned off. It was a technical decision, partially based on the noise factor. This is standard procedure at these events.\" Nevertheless, a commercial single and video of the performance reached the Top 20 on the US Hot 100, giving Houston the biggest chart hit for a performance of the national anthem.\nHouston donated her share of the proceeds to the American Red Cross Gulf Crisis Fund and was named to the Red Cross Board of Governors. Her rendition was critically acclaimed and is considered the benchmark for singers; VH1 listed the performance as one of the greatest moments that rocked TV. Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the single was rereleased, with all profits going towards the firefighters and victims of the attacks. It peaked at No. 6 in the Hot 100 and was certified platinum.\nLater in 1991, Houston put together her Welcome Home Heroes concert with HBO for the soldiers fighting in the Persian Gulf War and their families. The free concert took place at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia in front of 3,500 servicemen and women. HBO descrambled the concert so that it was free for everyone to watch. The show gave HBO its highest ratings ever. Houston then embarked on her third world tour, the I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour, which Houston would give 96 shows, including a historic ten date sold-out residency at Wembley Arena in London. The concert tour produced mixed to positive reviews. While The Sun Sentinel argued that Houston should've opted for smaller venues and theaters that were \"far more suitable to her sophistication and talent\", USA Today praised Houston for \"shak[ing] the confinements of her recordings' calculated productions and gets downright gutsy and soulful\"\n\n1992\u20131994: The Bodyguard\nWith the success of her music, Houston received offers of film work, including work with Robert De Niro, Quincy Jones and Spike Lee, but she did not feel the time was right. Her first film role was in The Bodyguard, released in 1992. Houston played a star who is stalked by a crazed fan and hires a bodyguard (played by Kevin Costner) to protect her. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed audiences to look past the interracial nature of her character's relationship with Costner's character. However, controversy arose as some felt Houston's face had been intentionally left out of the advertising to hide the film's interracial relationship. In a 1993 interview with Rolling Stone, Houston said that \"people know who Whitney Houston is \u2013 I'm black. You can't hide that fact.\" The film received mixed reviews. Writing for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley wrote that Houston was merely \"playing herself\", but came out \"largely unscathed if that is possible in so cockamamie an undertaking\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times felt Houston lacked chemistry with Costner. Houston was nominated for a Razzie Award but also received favorable acting nods, including a nomination for Outstanding Actress at the NAACP Image Awards, four acting nods at the 1993 MTV Movie Awards and a People's Choice Award nod for Favorite Actress in a Dramatic Motion Picture. Upon its release, The Bodyguard grossed more than $121 million in the U.S. and $410 million worldwide, making it one of the top 100 highest-grossing films in history at its time of release. It remains in the top forty of most successful R-rated films in box office history.\nThe film's soundtrack also enjoyed success. Houston executive produced the soundtrack along with Davis and recorded six songs for the album. Rolling Stone described it as \"nothing more than pleasant, tasteful and urbane\". The soundtrack's lead single was \"I Will Always Love You\", written and originally recorded by Dolly Parton in 1974. Houston's version was highly acclaimed by critics, regarding it as her \"signature song\" or \"iconic performance\". Rolling Stone and USA Today called her rendition a tour-de-force. The single peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot R&B Singles charts for fourteen and eleven weeks respectively, record-setting numbers at the time, while also topping the Adult Contemporary chart for five weeks, resulting in her fourth record-setting \"triple-crown\" number one single. The single was later certified diamond by the RIAA for sales of ten million copies, becoming Houston's first diamond single. She posthumously joined singers Taylor Swift and Mariah Carey as only the third female artist to earn both a diamond single and album. In January 1993, the song became the first single by a solo artist in US history to sell four million copies, later being certified 4x platinum by the RIAA and becoming the bestselling single in US history, a feat later surpassed by Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind '97\". It remains the bestselling US physical single in history by a female recording artist.\nThe song was a global success, topping the charts in almost all countries. With 24 million copies sold, it became the best-selling single ever by a female solo artist. Houston won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1994 for \"I Will Always Love You\". In addition, it won the MTV Movie Award for Best Song from a Film, two American Music Awards in the favorite pop and soul song categories and two Soul Train Music Awards, including best single by a woman and song of the year. The soundtrack topped the Billboard 200 chart and remained there for 20 weeks. It remains the second longest cumulative number one album by a female artist on the chart after singer Adele's 21. The soundtrack also became one of the fastest-selling albums in history. During Christmas week of 1992, it sold over a million copies within a week, becoming the first album in music history to achieve that feat under the Nielsen SoundScan system. Houston released four more singles from the soundtrack. Two of which, \"I'm Every Woman\" and \"I Have Nothing\", both reaching the top five. On the week of March 13, 1993, Houston became the first solo artist in history to ever have three singles in the top 11 simultaneously and the first artist in general to do so since the beginning of SoundScan. Both \"I'm Every Woman\" and \"I Have Nothing\" hit number one in other Billboard charts, with the former topping the Dance Club Songs chart, and the latter becoming Houston's tenth number one song on the adult contemporary chart. \"Run to You\" was released, peaking at number 31 on the Hot 100, while a remix of \"Queen of the Night\" made number one on the dance chart. On November 3, 1993, Houston made history again when The Bodyguard became the first album by a female artist to be certified ten times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, which also made it technically the first album by a female artist to be certified Diamond. It has since gone on to sell more than 18 million copies alone in the United States, with total sales reaching 45 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female artist ever and also the best-selling soundtrack album in history, earning Houston several Guinness World Records.\nHouston won the 1994 Grammy Award for Album of the Year for the soundtrack, making her just the second black female artist to win in the category after Natalie Cole won it in 1992 for her album, Unforgettable... with Love. Houston won a record eight American Music Awards, with the album winning in the pop, R&B and adult contemporary album categories, the only album in its history to do so. Houston also received its highest honor, the Award of Merit, becoming at thirty, the youngest female recipient. In addition, the album also won Houston a record fifteen Billboard awards, including 11 at the actual ceremony, three Soul Train Music Awards, including the Sammy Davis, Jr. Award as Entertainer of the Year, five NAACP Image Awards including Entertainer of the Year, a record five World Music Awards, a Juno Award and a BRIT award. Nine years after she first appeared on the charts, Houston was a cover story for Rolling Stone, appearing on the June 10, 1993, issue.\n\nFollowing the success of The Bodyguard, Houston embarked on another expansive global tour (The Bodyguard World Tour) in 1993\u201394. Her concerts, movie and recording grosses made her the third highest-earning female entertainer of 1993\u201394, just behind Oprah Winfrey and Barbra Streisand according to Forbes. Houston placed in the top five of Entertainment Weekly's annual \"Entertainer of the Year\" ranking and was labeled by Premiere magazine as one of the 100 most powerful people in Hollywood.\nIn October 1994, Houston attended and performed at a state dinner in the White House honoring newly elected South African president Nelson Mandela. At the end of her world tour, Houston performed three concerts in South Africa to honor President Mandela, playing to over 200,000 people; this made her the first major musician to visit the newly unified and apartheid free nation following Mandela's winning election. Portions of Whitney: The Concert for a New South Africa were broadcast live on HBO with funds of the concerts being donated to various charities in South Africa. The event was considered the nation's \"biggest media event since the inauguration of Nelson Mandela\". After two performances in Brunei and Singapore early in 1995,  Houston's children's charity organization was awarded a VH1 Honor for all the charitable work in June of that year.\n\n1995\u20131997: Waiting to Exhale, The Preacher's Wife and Cinderella\nIn 1995, Houston starred alongside Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon in her second film, Waiting to Exhale, a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston played the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as \"a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers\". After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide, it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as How Stella Got Her Groove Back and the Tyler Perry movies that became popular in the 2000s. The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens rather than as stereotypes. The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast. The New York Times said: \"Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a pop star in 'The Bodyguard' seem so distant.\" Houston was nominated for a second acting NAACP Image Awards nod for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for her role in the film, but lost to her co-star Bassett.\nThe film's accompanying soundtrack was written and produced by Babyface and was executive produced by Houston and Clive Davis. Though Babyface originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she \"wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction\" and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film's message about strong women. Consequently, the album featured a range of contemporary R&B female recording artists along with Houston, such as Mary J. Blige, Brandy, Toni Braxton, Aretha Franklin and Patti LaBelle. Houston's \"Exhale (Shoop Shoop)\" became just the third single in music history to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after Michael Jackson's \"You Are Not Alone\" and Mariah Carey's \"Fantasy\". It would be Houston's eleventh and final number one single in her lifetime. It also would spend a record eleven consecutive weeks at the No. 2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R&B charts, her second most successful single on that chart after \"I Will Always Love You\".\n\"Count On Me\", a song Houston co-wrote and composed with her brother Michael and Babyface and made into a duet with longtime friend CeCe Winans, hit the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 and later won Houston two ASCAP Awards, a BMI Award and two Grammy Award nominations including Best Song Written for Visual Media. A third Houston single, and the last song from the soundtrack to be released, \"Why Does It Hurt So Bad\", reached number 26 on the Hot 100. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 in January 1996 and would later be certified seven-times platinum in the United States, with total worldwide sales reaching 12 million. The soundtrack received strong reviews; as Entertainment Weekly stated: \"the album goes down easy, just as you'd expect from a package framed by Whitney Houston tracks ... the soundtrack waits to exhale, hovering in sensuous suspense\" and has since ranked it as one of the 100 Best Movie Soundtracks. Houston would win two American Music Awards at the 1997 ceremony for the soundtrack including Top Soundtrack and for Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist.\nIn 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy The Preacher's Wife, with Denzel Washington. She plays the gospel-singing wife of a pastor (Courtney B. Vance). It was largely an updated remake of the 1948 film The Bishop's Wife, which starred Loretta Young, David Niven and Cary Grant. Houston earned $10 million for the role, making her one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood at the time and the highest-earning African-American actress in Hollywood. The movie, with its all African-American cast, was a moderate success, earning about $50 million at the U.S. box offices. The movie gave Houston the strongest reviews of her acting career. The San Francisco Chronicle said Houston \"is rather angelic herself, displaying a divine talent for being virtuous and flirtatious at the same time\" and she \"exudes gentle yet spirited warmth, especially when praising the Lord in her gorgeous singing voice\". Houston won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture for her role in the film.\nFor the film's accompanying gospel soundtrack, Houston co-produced nine of the album's fifteen tracks with Mervyn Warren. Six of the more traditional gospel material was recorded with the Georgia Mass Choir at the Great Star Rising Baptist Church in Atlanta. Houston also recorded a duet with Shirley Caesar and the soundtrack also featured her mother Cissy Houston. Upon its release, it became the first gospel album by a female artist to debut at number one on the Billboard Top Gospel Albums chart. The album sold six million copies worldwide, including three million alone in the United States, becoming the best-selling gospel album ever. The album featured two hit singles, the Grammy-nominated \"I Believe in You and Me\" and \"Step by Step\". In addition to its commercial success, it was also received positively by critics. The album itself was nominated for the Best R&B Album at the 1998 Grammys. However, Houston snubbed the ceremony due to the album not getting a gospel nomination. That year, Houston received two Dove Awards for the album, including Best Traditional Gospel Recorded Song for \"I Go to the Rock\", while also receiving the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Gospel Artist alongside the Georgia Mass Choir.\nIn 1997, Houston's production company changed its name to BrownHouse Productions from Houston Productions and was joined by Debra Martin Chase. Their goal was \"to show aspects of the lives of African-Americans that have not been brought to the screen before\" while improving how African-Americans are portrayed in film and television. Their first project was a made-for-television remake of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella. In addition to co-producing, Houston starred in the film as the Fairy Godmother along with Brandy, Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg and Bernadette Peters. Houston was initially offered the role of Cinderella in 1993, but other projects intervened. The film is notable for its multi-racial cast and non-stereotypical message. An estimated 60 million viewers tuned into the special giving ABC its highest TV ratings in 16 years. The movie received seven Emmy nominations including Outstanding Variety, Musical or Comedy, while winning Outstanding Art Direction in a Variety, Musical or Comedy Special.\nHouston and Chase then obtained the rights to the story of Dorothy Dandridge. Houston was to play Dandridge, the first African-American actress to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Houston wanted the story told with dignity and honor. However, Halle Berry also had rights to the project and got her version going first. Later that year, Houston paid tribute to her idols, such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross and Dionne Warwick, by performing their hits during the three-night HBO Concert Classic Whitney: Live from Washington, D.C. The special raised over $300,000 for the Children's Defense Fund. In February 1998, Houston, 34, received the Quincy Jones Award for outstanding career achievements in the field of entertainment at the 12th Soul Train Music Awards.\n\n1998\u20132000: My Love Is Your Love and Whitney: The Greatest Hits\nBy 1998, Houston hadn't recorded a full-length studio album in eight years. During discussion over a possible greatest hits album with Clive Davis, however, it was agreed that Houston should return to the studio for a brand new album instead. Recorded and mixed in a six-week period - fastest for any Houston recording - Houston released the album, My Love Is Your Love, on November 17, 1998. The album featured production from Rodney Jerkins, Wyclef Jean and Missy Elliott. Led by the Academy Award-winning duet, \"When You Believe\", with singer Mariah Carey off the Prince of Egypt soundtrack in a week full of star-studded releases, the album debuted and peaked at number thirteen on the Billboard 200, while later topping the European Top 100 Albums chart for six weeks, starting in August 1999. The album gave Houston some of her strongest reviews ever. Rolling Stone said Houston was singing \"with a bite in her voice\" and The Village Voice called it \"Whitney's sharpest and most satisfying so far\". Billboard magazine noted the album had a \"funkier and edgier sound than past releases\" and saw Houston \"handling urban dance, hip hop, mid-tempo R&B, reggae, torch songs and ballads all with great dexterity.\"\nThe album launched five top 40 singles in the Billboard Hot 100, including three top five singles, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", \"It's Not Right but It's Okay\" and \"My Love Is Your Love\". \"When You Believe\" peaked at No. 15 on the Hot 100 while the album's final single, \"I Learned from the Best\", reached No. 27. The album would itself stay on the charts for more than two years and would later be certified four times platinum in the US for sales of four million copies, moving 11 million copies globally altogether. Four of the five singles reached number one on the US Dance Club Songs chart thanks to remixes by the likes of Hex Hector, Junior Vasquez and Thunderpuss. In Europe, the title track became massively successful, topping the Eurochart Hot 100 and selling over three million copies worldwide. In February 2000, Houston won her sixth and final competitive Grammy for \"It's Not Right but It's Okay\" in the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance category. The European success of the album helped it to win the MTV Europe Music Award for Best R&B. Houston earned four additional Grammy nominations for the album and the music video for \"Heartbreak Hotel\" gave Houston her first MTV Video Music Award nomination in 13 years.\nIn 1999, Houston participated in VH-1's Divas Live '99, alongside Brandy, Mary J. Blige, Tina Turner and Cher. The same year, Houston hit the road with her 70-date My Love Is Your Love World Tour. While the North American leg was plagued by cancellations with Houston's publicist citing \"throat problems and a 'bronchitis situation'\", the European leg became hugely successful ending the year as the highest-grossing arena tour of the year in Europe. In November 1999, the Recording Industry Association of America hosted its Century Awards and named Houston the top-selling R&B female artist of the century with certified US sales of 51 million records at the time while the soundtrack to The Bodyguard received awards for being the top-selling soundtrack album of the century and the best-selling album of the century by a female artist. In March 2000, Houston earned a special honor at the 2000 Soul Train Music Awards as the female artist of the decade for her extraordinary artistic contributions during the 1990s.\nIn May 2000, Whitney: The Greatest Hits was released worldwide. The double disc set peaked at number five in the United States, reaching number one in the United Kingdom. In addition, the album reached the Top 10 in many other countries. While ballad songs were left unchanged, the album features house/club remixes of many of Houston's up-tempo hits. Included on the album were four new songs: \"Could I Have This Kiss Forever\" (a duet with Enrique Iglesias), \"Same Script, Different Cast\" (a duet with Deborah Cox), \"If I Told You That\" (a duet with George Michael) and \"Fine\" and three hits that had never appeared on a Houston album: \"One Moment in Time\", \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful\", a duet with Jermaine Jackson from his 1986 Precious Moments album. Along with the album, an accompanying VHS and DVD was released featuring the music videos to Houston's greatest hits, as well as several hard-to-find live performances including her 1983 debut on The Merv Griffin Show and interviews. The set was later certified five times platinum in the US for sales of five million copies, while worldwide sales reached 11 million.\n\n2000\u20132008: Just Whitney and personal struggles\nThough Houston was seen as a \"good girl\" with a perfect image in the 1980s and early 1990s, her behavior had changed by 2000. She was often hours late for interviews, photo shoots and rehearsals, she canceled concerts and talk-show appearances and there were reports of erratic behavior. Missed performances and weight loss led to rumors about Houston using drugs with her husband. On January 11, 2000, while traveling with Brown, airport security guards discovered half an ounce of marijuana in Houston's handbag at Keahole-Kona International Airport in Hawaii, but she departed before authorities could arrive. Charges against her were later dropped, but rumors of drug usage by Houston and Brown would continue to surface. Two months later, Clive Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Houston had been scheduled to perform at the event, but was a no-show.\nShortly thereafter, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards, but was fired from the event by musical director and longtime friend Burt Bacharach. Her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards, author Steve Pond revealed that \"Houston's voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery and her attitude was casual, almost defiant\"; though she was supposed to perform \"Over the Rainbow\", she would sing a different song during rehearsals. Houston later admitted she had been fired.\nIn May 2000, Houston's longtime executive assistant and friend, Robyn Crawford, resigned from Houston's management company. In 2019, Crawford said she had left after Houston declined to seek help for her drug dependency. The following month, Rolling Stone published a story stating that Cissy Houston and others had held a July 1999 intervention in which they unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Whitney to obtain drug treatment.\nIn August 2001, Houston signed one of the biggest record deals in music history, with Arista/BMG. She renewed her contract for $100 million to release six new albums, for which she would also earn royalties. She later made an appearance on Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special, where her extremely thin frame further spurred rumors of drug use. Her publicist stated, \"Whitney has been under stress due to family matters and when she is under stress she doesn't eat.\" In a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston acknowledged that drug use had been the reason for her weight loss. She canceled a second performance scheduled for the following night. Within weeks, Houston's rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was re-released after the September 11 attacks, with the proceeds donated to the New York Firefighters 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Fraternal Order of Police. It reached No. 6 on the US Hot 100, topping its previous position.\nIn 2002, Houston became embroiled in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise. Although the company was started by her father to manage her career, it was actually run by company president Kevin Skinner. Skinner filed a breach of contract lawsuit and sued for $100 million (but lost), stating that Houston owed the company previously unpaid compensation for helping to negotiate her $100 million contract with Arista Records and for sorting out legal matters. Houston stated that her 81-year-old father had nothing to do with the lawsuit. Although Skinner tried to claim otherwise, John Houston never appeared in court. Houston's father later died in February 2003. The lawsuit was dismissed on April 5, 2004, and Skinner was awarded nothing.\nAlso in 2002, Houston gave an interview with Diane Sawyer to promote her then-upcoming album. During the primetime special, she spoke about her drug use and marriage, among other topics. Addressing the ongoing rumors that she was abusing crack cocaine, she said, \"First of all, let's get one thing straight. Crack is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is wack.\" The \"crack is wack\" line was drawn from a mural that Keith Haring painted in 1986 on the handball court at 128th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan. Houston did, however, admit to using alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and pills; she also acknowledged that her mother had urged her to seek help regarding her drug use. She also denied having an eating disorder and that her very thin appearance was connected to drug use. She further stated that Bobby Brown had never hit her, but acknowledged that she had hit him.\nIn December 2002, Houston released her fifth studio album, Just Whitney. The album included productions from then-husband Bobby Brown, as well as Missy Elliott and Babyface, and marked the first time that Houston did not produce with Clive Davis, as Davis had been released by top management at BMG. Upon its release, Just Whitney received mixed reviews. The album debuted at number 9 on the Billboard 200 chart and it had the highest first week sales of any album Houston had ever released. The four singles released from the album did not fare well on the Billboard Hot 100, but became dance chart hits. Just Whitney was certified platinum in the United States and sold about two million worldwide.\nIn late 2003, Houston released her first Christmas album One Wish: The Holiday Album, with a collection of traditional holiday songs. Houston produced the album with Mervyn Warren and Gordon Chambers. A single titled \"One Wish (for Christmas)\" reached the Top 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart and the album was certified gold in the US.\nIn December 2003, Brown was charged with battery following an altercation during which he threatened to beat Houston and then assaulted her. Police reported that Houston had visible injuries to her face.\nHaving always been a touring artist, Houston spent most of 2004 touring and performing in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Russia. In September 2004, she gave a surprise performance at the World Music Awards in a tribute to long-time friend Clive Davis. After the show, Davis and Houston announced plans to go into the studio to work on her new album.\nIn early 2004, Brown starred in his own reality TV program, Being Bobby Brown, on Bravo. The show provided a view of the domestic goings-on in the Brown household. Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in unflattering moments. Years later, The Guardian opined that through her participation in the show, Houston had lost \"the last remnants of her dignity\". The Hollywood Reporter said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\". Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot and continued Houston's successful forays into film and television. The show was not renewed for a second season after Houston said that she would no longer appear in it and Brown and Bravo could not come to an agreement for another season.\n\n2009\u20132012: Return and I Look to You\nHouston gave her first interview in seven years in September 2009, appearing on Oprah Winfrey's season premiere. The interview was billed as \"the most anticipated music interview of the decade\". Houston admitted on the show to having used drugs with Brown during their marriage; she said Brown had \"laced marijuana with rock cocaine\". She told Winfrey that before The Bodyguard her drug use was light, that she used drugs more heavily after the film's success and the birth of her daughter and that by 1996 \"[doing drugs] was an everyday thing ... I wasn't happy by that point in time. I was losing myself.\"\nHouston told Winfrey that she had attended a 30-day rehabilitation program. Houston also acknowledged to Oprah that her drug use had continued after rehabilitation and that at one point, her mother obtained a court order and the assistance of law enforcement to press her into receiving further drug treatment. (In her 2013 book, Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss and the Night the Music Stopped, Cissy Houston described the scene she encountered at Whitney Houston's house in 2005 as follows: \"Somebody had spray-painted the walls and door with big glaring eyes and strange faces. Evil eyes, staring out like a threat... In another room, there was a big, framed photo of [Whitney] \u2013 but someone had cut [her] head out. It was beyond disturbing, seeing my daughter's face cut out like that.\" This visit led Cissy to return with law enforcement and perform an intervention.) Houston also told Winfrey that Brown had been emotionally abusive during their marriage and had even spat on her on one occasion. When Winfrey asked Houston if she was drug-free, Houston responded, \"'Yes, ma'am. I mean, you know, don't think I don't have desires for it.'\"\n\nHouston released her new album, I Look to You, in August 2009. The album's first two singles were the title track \"I Look to You\" and \"Million Dollar Bill\". The album entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1, with Houston's best opening week sales of 305,000 copies, marking Houston's first number one album since The Bodyguard and Houston's first studio album to reach number one since 1987's Whitney. Houston also appeared on European television programs to promote the album. She performed the song \"I Look to You\" on the German television show Wetten, dass..?. Houston appeared as a guest mentor on The X Factor in the United Kingdom. She performed \"Million Dollar Bill\" on the following day's results show, completing the song even as a strap in the back of her dress popped open two seconds into the performance. She later commented that she \"sang [herself] out of [her] clothes\". The performance was poorly received by the British media and was described as \"weird\" and \"ungracious\".\nDespite this reception, \"Million Dollar Bill\" jumped to its peak from 14 to number 5 (her first UK top 5 for over a decade). Three weeks after its release, I Look to You went gold. Houston appeared on the Italian version of The X Factor, where she performed \"Million Dollar Bill\" to excellent reviews. In November, Houston performed \"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\" at the 2009 American Music Awards in Los Angeles, California. Two days later, Houston performed \"Million Dollar Bill\" and \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" on the Dancing with the Stars season 9 finale.\n\nHouston later embarked on a world tour, entitled the Nothing but Love World Tour. It was her first world tour in over ten years and was announced as a triumphant comeback. However, some poor reviews and rescheduled concerts brought negative media attention. Houston canceled some concerts because of illness and received widespread negative reviews from fans who were disappointed in the quality of her voice and performance. Some fans reportedly walked out of her concerts.\nIn January 2010, Houston was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards, one for Best Female Artist and one for Best Music Video. She won the award for Best Music Video for her single \"I Look to You\". On January 16, she received The BET Honors Award for Entertainer citing her lifetime achievements spanning over 25 years in the industry. Houston also performed the song \"I Look to You\" on the 2011 BET Celebration of Gospel, with gospel\u2013jazz singer Kim Burrell, held at the Staples Center, Los Angeles. The performance aired on January 30, 2011.\nIn May 2011, Houston enrolled in a rehabilitation center again, citing drug and alcohol problems. A representative for Houston said that the outpatient treatment was a part of Houston's \"longstanding recovery process\". In September 2011, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Houston would produce and star alongside Jordin Sparks and Mike Epps in the remake of the 1976 film Sparkle. In the film, Houston portrays Sparks's \"not-so encouraging\" mother. Houston is also credited as an executive producer of the film. Debra Martin Chase, producer of Sparkle, stated that Houston deserved the title considering she had been there from the beginning in 2001, when Houston obtained Sparkle production rights. R&B singer Aaliyah \u2013 originally tapped to star as Sparkle \u2013 died in a 2001 plane crash. Her death derailed production, which would have begun in 2002. Houston's remake of Sparkle was filmed in late 2011 over two months and was released by TriStar Pictures. On May 21, 2012, \"Celebrate\", the last song Houston recorded with Sparks, premiered at RyanSeacrest.com. It was made available for digital download on iTunes on June 5. The song was featured on the Sparkle: Music from the Motion Picture soundtrack as the first official single. The movie was released on August 17, 2012, in the United States.\n\nPersonal life\nHouston was Christian and made it a point to sing gospel songs during all of her live concert tours. When Houston was sixteen, she met Robyn Crawford, then a collegiate basketball player for Monmouth University, while both worked as counselors at a youth summer camp in East Orange. The two became fast friends and Houston later described Crawford as the \"sister [she] never had\". After Houston graduated, they became roommates at an apartment complex in Woodbridge, 20 miles from East Orange. Shortly after Houston signed with Arista, Crawford became the singer's executive assistant. During Houston's early fame, rumors speculated of a romance between Houston and Crawford, which both denied during a Time magazine interview in 1987. In 2019, Crawford wrote in her memoirs, A Song for You: My Life with Whitney Houston, that the early part of their friendship had been physical before Houston signed a recording deal. Crawford remained Houston's close friend and employee until 2000.\nThroughout the 1980s, Houston was romantically linked to musician Jermaine Jackson, American football star Randall Cunningham, restaurateur Brad Johnson and actor Eddie Murphy. She then met R&B singer Bobby Brown at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. After a three-year courtship, the two were married on July 18, 1992. The two singers occasionally collaborated on songs, including the hit record, \"Something in Common\". Brown would go on to have several run-ins with the law for drunken driving, drug possession and battery, including some jail time. On March 4, 1993, Houston gave birth to their daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown (March 4, 1993 \u2013 July 26, 2015), the couple's only child. Houston revealed in a 1993 interview with Barbara Walters that she had a miscarriage during the filming of The Bodyguard. Throughout their marriage, Houston and Brown tried having another child, with Houston suffering several miscarriages, including one in July 1994 and another in December 1996.\nIn December 2003, Brown was charged with battery following an altercation during which he threatened to beat Houston and then assaulted her. Police reported that Houston had visible injuries to her face. In September 2006, a year after Being Bobby Brown aired, Houston filed for legal separation from Brown, later filing for divorce the following month. The divorce was granted on April 24, 2007, with Houston admitting Brown was \"unreliable\" in supporting their teenage daughter.\n\nDeath and funeral\nHouston reportedly appeared \"disheveled\" and \"erratic\" in the days before her death. On February 9, 2012, Houston visited singers Brandy and Monica, together with Clive Davis, at their rehearsals for Davis's pre-Grammy Awards party at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills. That same day, she made her last public performance when she joined Kelly Price on stage in Hollywood, California, and sang \"Jesus Loves Me.\"\n\nTwo days later, on February 11, Houston was found unconscious in Suite 434 at the Beverly Hilton, submerged in the bathtub. Beverly Hills paramedics arrived about 3:30 pm, found Houston unresponsive, and performed CPR. Houston was pronounced dead at 3:55 pm PST. The cause of death was not immediately known; local police said there were \"no obvious signs of criminal intent\". \nAn invitation-only memorial service was held for Houston at her home church, New Hope Baptist Church, in Newark, New Jersey, on February 18, 2012. The service was scheduled for two hours but lasted four. Among those who performed at the funeral were Stevie Wonder (rewritten version of \"Ribbon in the Sky\" and \"Love's in Need of Love Today\"), CeCe Winans (\"Don't Cry\" and \"Jesus Loves Me\"), Alicia Keys (\"Send Me an Angel\"), Kim Burrell (rewritten version of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\") and R. Kelly (\"I Look to You\").\nThe performances were interspersed with hymns by the church choir and remarks by Clive Davis, Houston's record producer; Kevin Costner; Rickey Minor, her music director; Dionne Warwick, her cousin; and Ray Watson, her security guard for the last 11 years. Aretha Franklin was listed on the program, and was expected to sing, but was unable to attend the service. Bobby Brown departed shortly after the service began. Houston was buried on February 19, 2012, in Fairview Cemetery, in Westfield, New Jersey, next to her father, John Russell Houston, who had died in 2003.\nOn March 22, 2012, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported that Houston's death was caused by drowning and the \"effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use\". The office said the amount of cocaine found in Houston's body indicated that she used the substance shortly before her death. Toxicology results revealed additional drugs in her system: diphenhydramine (Benadryl), alprazolam (Xanax; a potent tranquilizer of moderate duration within the triazolobenzodiazepine group of chemicals called benzodiazepines), cannabis, and cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril). The manner of death was listed as an \"accident\".\n\nReaction\nPre-Grammy party\nThe February 11, 2012 Clive Davis pre-Grammy party that Houston had been expected to attend, which featured many of the biggest names in music and film, went on as scheduled \u2013 although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start:\n\nBy now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.\nTony Bennett spoke of Houston's death before performing at Davis's party. He said, \"First, it was Michael Jackson, then Amy Winehouse, now, the magnificent Whitney Houston.\" Bennett sang \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\" and said of Houston: \"When I first heard her, I called Clive Davis and said, 'You finally found the greatest singer I've ever heard in my life.'\"\nSome celebrities opposed Davis's decision to continue with the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body was still in the building. Chaka Khan, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: \"I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.'\"\nSharon Osbourne condemned the Davis party, declaring: \"I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't want to be in a hotel room when there's someone you admire who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong.\"\n\nFurther reaction and tributes\nMany other celebrities released statements responding to Houston's death. Darlene Love, Houston's godmother, hearing the news of her death, said, \"It felt like I had been struck by a lightning bolt in my gut.\" Dolly Parton, whose song \"I Will Always Love You\" was covered by Houston, said, \"I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'\" Aretha Franklin said, \"It's so stunning and unbelievable. I couldn't believe what I was reading coming across the TV screen.\" Others paying tribute included Mariah Carey, Quincy Jones, and Oprah Winfrey.\nMoments after news of her death emerged, ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, BBC News, Sky News all broke from their regularly scheduled programming to dedicate time to non-stop coverage of Houston's death. The networks and channels featured live interviews with people who had known Houston, including those that had worked with her, along with some of her peers in the music industry. Saturday Night Live displayed a photo of a smiling Houston, alongside Molly Shannon, from her 1996 appearance. MTV and VH1 interrupted their regularly scheduled programming on Sunday, February 12, to air many of Houston's classic videos, with MTV often airing news segments in between and featuring various reactions from fans and celebrities.\nThe first full hour after the news of Houston's death broke saw 2,481,652 tweets and retweets on Twitter alone.\nHouston's former husband, Bobby Brown, was reported to be \"in and out of crying fits\" after receiving the news. He did not cancel a scheduled performance, and within hours of his ex-wife's sudden death, an audience in Mississippi watched as Brown blew kisses skyward, tearfully saying: \"I love you, Whitney.\"\nKen Ehrlich, executive producer of the 54th Grammy Awards, announced that Jennifer Hudson would perform a tribute to Houston at the February 12, 2012, ceremony. He said, \"Event organizers believed Hudson \u2013 an Academy Award-winning actress and Grammy Award-winning artist \u2013 could perform a respectful musical tribute to Houston.\" Ehrlich went on to say, \"It's too fresh in everyone's memory to do more at this time, but we would be remiss if we didn't recognize Whitney's remarkable contribution to music fans in general and in particular her close ties with the Grammy telecast and her Grammy wins and nominations over the years.\" At the start of the awards ceremony, footage of Houston performing \"I Will Always Love You\" from the 1994 Grammys was shown following a prayer read by host LL Cool J. Later in the program, following a montage of photos of musicians who died in 2011 with Houston singing \"Saving All My Love for You\" at the 1986 Grammys, Hudson paid tribute to Houston and the other artists by performing \"I Will Always Love You\". The tribute was partially credited for the Grammys telecast getting its second highest ratings in history.\nHouston was honored with various tributes at the 43rd NAACP Image Awards, held on February 17. An image montage of Houston and important black figures who died in 2011 was followed by video footage from the 1994 ceremony, which depicted her accepting two Image Awards for outstanding female artist and entertainer of the year. Following the video tribute, Yolanda Adams delivered a rendition of \"I Love the Lord\" from The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack. In the finale of the ceremony, Kirk Franklin and the Family started their performance with \"The Greatest Love of All\".\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie said that all New Jersey state flags would be flown at half-staff on Tuesday, February 21, to honor Houston. The 2012 Brit Awards, which took place at the O2 Arena in London on February 21, also paid tribute to Houston by playing a 30-second video montage of her music videos with a snippet of \"One Moment in Time\" as the background music in the ceremony's first segment. Houston was also featured, alongside other recently deceased figures from the film industry, in the In Memoriam montage at the 84th Academy Awards on February 26, 2012.\nIn June 2012, the year's McDonald's Gospelfest in Newark was dedicated as a tribute to Houston.\nBeyonc\u00e9 performed a tribute to Houston during her revue Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live in May 2012 at the Revel resort by performing the first verse and chorus of \"I Will Always Love You\".\nHouston topped the list of Google searches in 2012, both globally and in the United States, according to Google's Annual Zeitgeist most-popular searches list. Her death was ranked as the most memorable entertainment event in television history, according to a study by Sony Electronics and the Nielsen Television Research Company. \nOn May 17, 2017, Bebe Rexha released a single titled \"The Way I Are (Dance with Somebody)\" from her two-part album All Your Fault. The song mentions Houston's name in the opening lyrics, \"I'm sorry, I'm not the most pretty, I'll never ever sing like Whitney\", before going on to sample some of Houston's lyrics from \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" in the chorus. The song was in part made as a tribute to Whitney Houston's life.\n\nPosthumous sales\nAccording to representatives from Houston's record label, Houston sold 8 million records worldwide in the first ten months of the year she died. With just 24 hours passing between news of Houston's death and Nielsen SoundScan tabulating the weekly album charts, Whitney: The Greatest Hits climbed into the Top 10 with 64,000 copies sold; it was a 10,419 percent gain compared to the previous week. 43 of the top 100 most-downloaded tracks on iTunes were Houston songs, including \"I Will Always Love You\" from The Bodyguard at number one. Two other Houston classics, \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" and \"Greatest Love of All\", were in the top 10. As fans of Houston rushed to rediscover the singer's music, single digital track sales of the artist's music rose to more than 887,000 paid song downloads in 24 hours in the US alone.\nThe single \"I Will Always Love You\" returned to the Billboard Hot 100 after almost twenty years, peaking at number three and becoming a posthumous top-ten single for Houston, the first one since 2001. Two other Houston songs also jumped back on the Hot 100: \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" at 25 and \"Greatest Love of All\" at 36. Her death on February 11 ignited an incredible drive to her YouTube and Vevo pages. She went from 868,000 views in the week prior to her death to 40,200,000 views in the week following her death, a 45-fold increase.\nOn February 29, 2012, Houston became the first female artist, first solo artist and first posthumous artist in history ever to place three or more albums in the top ten of the US Billboard 200 simultaneously, with Whitney: The Greatest Hits at number 2, The Bodyguard at number 6 and Whitney Houston at number 9. On March 7, 2012, Houston claimed two more additional feats on the US Billboard charts: she became the first female act to place nine albums within the top 100 (with Whitney: The Greatest Hits at number 2, The Bodyguard at number 5, Whitney Houston at number 10, I Look to You at number 13, Triple Feature at number 21, My Love Is Your Love at number 31, I'm Your Baby Tonight at number 32, Just Whitney at number 50 and The Preacher's Wife at number 80); in addition, other Houston albums were also on the US Billboard Top 200 Album Chart at this time. Houston also became the second female act, after Adele, to place two albums in the top five of the US Billboard Top 200, with Whitney: The Greatest Hits at number 2 and The Bodyguard at number 5. In addition, Houston set a Guinness World Record by being the first female artist to place the most albums inside the Billboard 200 simultaneously by a female artist with ten. In October 2023, Houston made the list of the top ten highest-earning posthumous celebrities on Forbes earning $30 million, later winning Houston a posthumous Guinness World Records entry as the highest-earning posthumous female celebrity, her record 30th.\n\nPosthumous releases\nHouston's first posthumous greatest hits album, I Will Always Love You: The Best of Whitney Houston, was released on November 13, 2012, by RCA Records. It features the remastered versions of her number-one hits, an unreleased song titled \"Never Give Up\" and a duet version of \"I Look to You\" with R. Kelly. The album won two NAACP Image Awards for 'Outstanding Album' and 'Outstanding Song' (\"I Look to You\"). It was certified Gold by the RIAA in 2020. In October 2021, the album was reissued on vinyl and included Houston's first posthumous hit, \"Higher Love\". Since its release, it has spent more than 200 weeks on the Billboard 200, making it one of the longest-charting compilations in chart history, and the longest by a female artist. On the week of May 27, 2023, it replaced Madonna's The Immaculate Collection as the longest charting greatest hits album by a woman in the history of the Billboard 200 after it notched 149 weeks on the chart.\nHouston's posthumous live album, Her Greatest Performances (2014), was a US R&B number-one and received positive reviews by music critics. In 2017, the 25th anniversary reissue of The Bodyguard (soundtrack)\u2014I Wish You Love: More from The Bodyguard\u2014was released by Legacy Recordings. It includes film versions, remixes and live performances of Houston's Bodyguard songs.\nIn 2019, Houston and Kygo's version of \"Higher Love\" was released as a single. The record became a worldwide hit. It peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten in several countries. \"Higher Love\" was nominated at the 2020 Billboard Music Awards for \"Top Dance/Electronic Song of the Year\", the 2020 iHeartRadio Music Awards for \"Dance Song of the Year\" and \"Best Remix\". It was certified multi-platinum in the United States, Australia, Canada, Poland and the United Kingdom. The song was also a platinum hit in Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, and Spain.\nOn December 16, 2022, RCA released the soundtrack album to Houston's featured film biopic, titled, I Wanna Dance with Somebody (The Movie: Whitney New, Classic and Reimagined), to every digital download platform all over the world. The soundtrack includes reimagined remixes of some of Houston's classics and several newly discovered songs such as Houston's cover of CeCe Winans' \"Don't Cry\" (labeled as \"Don't Cry for Me\" on Houston's soundtrack) at the Commitment to Life AIDS benefit concert in Los Angeles in January 1994, remixed by house producer Sam Feldt.\nIn March 2023, Arista, Legacy Recordings and Gaither Music Group released Houston's first gospel compilation, I Go to the Rock: The Gospel Music of Whitney Houston. The album included three 1981 demo recordings recorded when Houston was 17, including \"Testimony\" and \"He Can Use Me\", while also featuring unearthed live recordings of Houston performing the gospel standards, \"This Day\", \"He/I Believe\" and, with CeCe Winans, an inspired rendition of \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\", recorded live at the second annual VH1 Honors in 1995 as well as previous recordings from The Bodyguard, The Preacher's Wife, and Sparkle. The album debuted at number two on Billboard's Top Gospel Albums chart, marking her first new entry on the chart since 1996. The album earned Houston a posthumous Billboard Music Award nomination for Top Gospel Album.\n\nArtistry\nHouston had a mezzo-soprano vocal range, and was referred to as \"the Voice\" for her vocal talent. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated Houston \"always had a great big voice, a technical marvel from its velvety depths to its ballistic middle register to its ringing and airy heights\". In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Houston second on their list of the greatest singers of all time, stating, \"The standard-bearer for R&B vocals, Whitney Houston possessed a soprano that was as powerful as it was tender. Take her cover of Dolly Parton's \"I Will Always Love You\", which became one of the defining singles of the 1990s; it opens with her gently brooding, her unaccompanied voice sounding like it's turning over the idea of leaving her lover behind with the lightest touch. By the end, it's transformed into a showcase for her limber, muscular upper register; she sings the title phrase with equal parts bone-deep feeling and technical perfection, turning the conflicted emotions at the song's heart into a jumping-off point for her life's next step.\"\nMatthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also acknowledged Houston's vocal prowess, enumerating ten performances, including \"How Will I Know\" at the 1986 MTV VMAs and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the 1991 Super Bowl. \"Whitney Houston was blessed with an astonishing vocal range and extraordinary technical skill, but what truly made her a great singer was her ability to connect with a song and drive home its drama and emotion with incredible precision\", he stated. \"She was a brilliant performer and her live shows often eclipsed her studio recordings.\" According to Newsweek, Houston had a four-octave range.\nElysa Gardner of the Los Angeles Times in her review for The Preacher's Wife Soundtrack highly praised Houston's vocal ability, commenting, \"She is first and foremost a pop diva \u2013 at that, the best one we have. No other female pop star \u2013 not Mariah Carey, not Celine Dion, not Barbra Streisand \u2013 quite rivals Houston in her exquisite vocal fluidity and purity of tone and her ability to infuse a lyric with mesmerizing melodrama.\"\nSinger and entertainer Michael Jackson named Houston as one of his musical inspirations, calling her a \"wonderful singer, real stylist. You hear one line, and you know who it is''.\nR&B singer Faith Evans stated: \"Whitney was not just a singer with a beautiful voice. She was a true musician. Her voice was an instrument and she knew how to use it. With the same complexity as someone who has mastered the violin or the piano, Whitney mastered the use of her voice. From every run to every crescendo\u2014she was in tune with what she could do with her voice and it's not something simple for a singer\u2014even a very talented one\u2014to achieve. Whitney is 'the Voice' because she worked for it. This is someone who was singing backup for her mom when she was 14 years old at nightclubs across the country. This is someone who sang backup for Chaka Khan when she was only 17. She had years and years of honing her craft on stage and in the studio before she ever got signed to a record label. Coming from a family of singers and surrounded by music; she pretty much had a formal education in music, just like someone who might attend a performing arts high school or major in voice in college.\"\nJon Caramanica of The New York Times commented, \"Her voice was clean and strong, with barely any grit, well suited to the songs of love and aspiration. [ ... ] Hers was a voice of triumph and achievement and it made for any number of stunning, time-stopping vocal performances.\" Mariah Carey stated, \"She [Whitney] has a really rich, strong mid-belt that very few people have. She sounds really good, really strong.\" While in her review of I Look to You, music critic Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times writes, \"[Houston's voice] stands like monuments upon the landscape of 20th century pop, defining the architecture of their times, sheltering the dreams of millions and inspiring the climbing careers of countless imitators\", adding \"When she was at her best, nothing could match her huge, clean, cool mezzo-soprano.\"\nLauren Everitt from BBC News commented on melisma used in Houston's recording and its influence. \"An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs a series of different notes into the single syllable\", stated Everitt. \"The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, but it was her rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [ ... ] But perhaps what Houston nailed best was moderation.\" Everitt said that \"[i]n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma for just the right moment.\"\nHouston's vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry. According to Linda Lister in Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars, she has been called the \"Queen of Pop\" for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Stephen Holden from The New York Times, in his review of Houston's Radio City Music Hall concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer, writing, \"Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices. While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather just stand there and sing.\" With regard to her singing style, he added: \"Her [Houston's] stylistic trademarks \u2013 shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration \u2013 infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning.\"\nHouston struggled with vocal problems in her later years. Gary Catona, a voice coach who began working with Houston in 2005, stated: \"'When I first started working with her in 2005, she had lost 99.9 percent of her voice ... She could barely speak, let alone sing. Her lifestyle choices had made her almost completely hoarse.'\" After Houston's death, Catona asserted that Houston's voice reached \"'about 75 to 80 percent'\" of its former capacity after he had worked with her. However, during the world tour that followed the release of I Look to You, \"YouTube videos surfaced, showing [Houston's] voice cracking, seemingly unable to hold the notes she was known for\".\nRegarding the musical style, Houston's vocal performances incorporated a wide variety of genres, including R&B, pop, rock, soul, gospel, funk, dance, Latin pop, disco, house, hip hop soul, new jack swing, opera, reggae, and Christmas. The lyrical themes in her recordings are mainly about love, social, religious and feminism. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame stated: \"Her sound expanded through collaborations with a wide array of artists, including Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross, Babyface, Missy Elliott, Bobby Brown, and Mariah Carey.\" While AllMusic commented that, \"Houston was able to handle big adult contemporary ballads, effervescent, stylish dance-pop and slick urban contemporary soul with equal dexterity\".\n\nLegacy and influence\nHouston has been regarded as one of the greatest vocalists of all time and a cultural icon. She is also recognized as one of the most influential R&B artists in history.\nDuring the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With Michael Jackson breaking down the color barrier for black men, Houston did the same for black women. She became the first black woman to receive heavy rotation on the network following the success of the \"How Will I Know\" video.\nBlack female artists, such as Janet Jackson and Anita Baker, were successful in popular music partly because Houston paved the way. Baker commented that \"Because of what Whitney and Sade did, there was an opening for me ... For radio stations, black women singers aren't taboo anymore.\"\nAllMusic noted her contribution to the success of black artists on the pop scene. The New York Times stated that \"Houston was a major catalyst for a movement within black music that recognized the continuity of soul, pop, jazz and gospel vocal traditions\". Richard Corliss of Time magazine commented on her initial success breaking various barriers:\n\nOf her first album's ten cuts, six were ballads. This chanteuse [Houston] had to fight for air play with hard rockers. The young lady had to stand uncowed in the locker room of macho rock. The soul strutter had to seduce a music audience that anointed few black artists with superstardom. [ ... ] She was a phenomenon waiting to happen, a canny tapping of the listener's yen for a return to the musical middle. And because every new star creates her own genre, her success has helped other blacks, other women, other smooth singers find an avid reception in the pop marketplace.\n\nStephen Holden of The New York Times said that Houston \"revitalized the tradition of strong gospel-oriented pop-soul singing\". Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times referred to Houston as a \"national treasure\". Jon Caramanica, another music critic of The New York Times, called Houston \"R&B's great modernizer\", adding \"slowly but surely reconciling the ambition and praise of the church with the movements and needs of the body and the glow of the mainstream\". He also drew comparisons between Houston's influence and other big names on 1980s pop:\n\nShe was, alongside Michael Jackson and Madonna, one of the crucial figures to hybridize pop in the 1980s, though her strategy was far less radical than that of her peers. Jackson and Madonna were by turns lascivious and brutish and, crucially, willing to let their production speak more loudly than their voices, an option Ms. Houston never went for. Also, she was less prolific than either of them, achieving most of her renown on the strength of her first three solo albums and one soundtrack, released from 1985 to 1992. If she was less influential than they were in the years since, it was only because her gift was so rare, so impossible to mimic. Jackson and Madonna built worldviews around their voices; Ms. Houston's voice was the worldview. She was someone more to be admired, like a museum piece, than to be emulated.\nThe Independent's music critic Andy Gill also wrote about Houston's influence on modern R&B and singing competitions, comparing it to Michael Jackson's. \"Because Whitney, more than any other single artist \u2013 Michael Jackson included \u2013 effectively mapped out the course of modern R&B, setting the bar for standards of soul vocalese and creating the original template for what we now routinely refer to as the 'soul diva' \", stated Gill. \"Jackson was a hugely talented icon, certainly, but he will be as well remembered (probably more so) for his presentational skills, his dazzling dance moves, as for his musical innovations. Whitney, on the other hand, just sang and the ripples from her voice continue to dominate the pop landscape.\" Gill said that there \"are few, if any, Jackson imitators on today's TV talent shows, but every other contestant is a Whitney wannabe, desperately attempting to emulate that wondrous combination of vocal effects \u2013 the flowing melisma, the soaring mezzo-soprano confidence, the tremulous fluttering that carried the ends of lines into realms of higher yearning\".\nSimilarly, Steve Huey from Allmusic wrote that the shadow of Houston's prodigious technique still looms large over nearly every pop diva and smooth urban soul singer \u2013 male or female \u2013 in her wake and spawned a legion of imitators. Rolling Stone stated that Houston \"redefined the image of a female soul icon and inspired singers ranging from Mariah Carey to Rihanna\". The magazine placed her 34th on their \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" list. Fifteen years later, in 2023, Houston was placed at second place, behind just Aretha Franklin. Essence ranked Houston at number five on their list of 50 Most Influential R&B Stars ever, calling her \"the diva to end all divas\". In October 2022, the same magazine ranked Houston at number one on its list of the ten greatest R&B solo artists of all time.\nA number of artists have acknowledged Whitney as an influence and inspiration, including Michael Jackson, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Sam Smith, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Celine Dion, Adele, Lucky Daye, Demi Lovato, Kelly Clarkson, Nicole Scherzinger, Kelly Rowland, Toni Braxton, Ashanti, Deborah Cox, Robin Thicke, Ciara, Brandy, Monica, LeAnn Rimes, Melanie Fiona, Jennifer Hudson, Christina Aguilera, Jordin Sparks, Alicia Keys, Leona Lewis, Ariana Grande, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, and Nicki Minaj.\n\nAwards and achievements\nHouston won numerous accolades, including two Emmy Awards, eight Grammy Awards (including two Grammy Hall of Fame honors), fourteen World Music Awards, sixteen Billboard Music Awards (46 Billboard awards in all) and twenty-two American Music Awards. Houston holds the record for the most American Music Awards received in a single year by a woman with eight wins in 1994 (overall tied with Michael Jackson). Houston was the first artist at the Billboard Music Awards to win more than 11 awards in one night at its fourth annual ceremony in 1993, which set a Guinness World Record at the time. Houston continues to hold the record for the most WMAs won in a single year, winning five trophies at the sixth World Music Awards in 1994. Houston is also the black female artist with the most Guinness World Records in history with 30.\nIn 1996, eleven years after debuting on BET for her music video to \"You Give Good Love\", Houston became the first female recipient of the BET Walk of Fame and the youngest-ever recipient of this honor at just 33 years old. Five years later, in 2001, Houston was the first artist to be given a BET Lifetime Achievement Award. Houston also remains the youngest recipient of the honor as she received the honor at the age of just 37. BET honored her again in 2010 when she received an award from The BET Honors. Houston is only one of two artists to receive all three honors from the BET network. \nIn May 2003, Houston placed at number three on VH1's list of \"50 Greatest Women of the Video Era\". In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary, ranking Houston at number nine. Similarly, she was ranked as one of the \"Top 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" by VH1 in September 2010. In November 2010, Billboard released its \"Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\" list and ranked Houston at number three who not only went on to earn eight number-one singles on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, but also landed five number ones on R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\nHouston's debut album is listed as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine and is on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Definitive 200 list. In 2004, Billboard picked the success of her first release on the charts as one of 110 Musical Milestones in its history. Houston's entrance into the music industry is considered one of the 25 musical milestones of the last 25 years, according to USA Today in 2007. It stated that she paved the way for Mariah Carey's chart-topping vocal gymnastics. In 2015, she was placed at number nine (second as a female) by Billboard on the list \"35 Greatest R&B Artists Of All Time\".\nHouston is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, with more than 220 million records sold worldwide. She is also the best-selling female R&B artist of the 20th century. Houston had also sold more physical singles than any other female solo artist in history. As of 2023, she was ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America with 61 million certified albums. Houston released seven studio albums and two soundtrack albums, all of which have been certified diamond, multi-platinum or platinum.\nIn November 1993, Houston became the first solo female recording artist to go Diamond with an album when her soundtrack to The Bodyguard was certified ten times platinum. In January 1994, she became the first solo artist to receive two Diamond albums after her debut album, Whitney Houston, was also certified ten times platinum. In October 2020, her 1987 release, Whitney, was certified Diamond as well, making Houston the first and only black recording artist to have three Diamond-certified albums. Those three albums are also among the best-selling albums of all time. Houston also is the only black female recording artist with more than six albums that have sold ten million copies or more globally. The Bodyguard remains the best-selling soundtrack album of all time, as well as the best-selling album of all time by a female recording artist, with global sales of over 50 million copies. Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" became the best-selling physical single by a woman in music history, as well as the best-selling single ever by a black recording artist, with sales of over 20 million copies worldwide. Her 1996 soundtrack for The Preacher's Wife is the best-selling gospel album of all time.\nIn 1997, the Franklin School in East Orange, New Jersey was renamed to The Whitney E. Houston Academy School of Creative and Performing Arts. She held an honorary Doctorate in Humanities from Grambling State University, Louisiana. Houston was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2013. In August 2014, she was inducted into the official Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in its second class. On January 15, 2020, more than 35 years after releasing her first record and on the 35th anniversary of the release of her landmark debut, Houston was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after her first nomination. In March 2020, the Library of Congress announced that Houston's 1992 single \"I Will Always Love You\" had been added to its National Recording Registry, a list of \"aural treasures worthy of preservation\" due to their \"cultural, historical and aesthetic importance\" in the American soundscape. In October 2020, the music video for \"I Will Always Love You\" surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube, making Houston the first solo 20th-century artist to have a video reach that milestone. In May 2023, Houston was one of the first of thirteen artists to be given the Brits Billion Award by the BPI for reaching 1 billion career streams in the United Kingdom. In July 2023, Houston became the first solo artist who debuted in the 1980s to have a song streamed over a billion times after her 1987 hit, \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\", reached that feat. In December 2023, the New Jersey Hall of Fame unveiled the Whitney Houston Service Area, formerly known as the Vauxhal Service Area at the Garden State Parkway.\nThe New Jersey Hall of Fame explained that the renaming was part of their \"ongoing program to honor its inductees by renaming Garden State Parkway service areas after them, and building displays about them\". Houston joined other New Jersey notables such as Toni Morrison, Frank Sinatra, Celia Cruz and Jon Bon Jovi in having service areas renamed after them.\n\nPhilanthropy\nHouston was a long-time supporter of several charities all around the world. In 1989, she established the Whitney Houston Foundation for Children. It offered medical assistance to sick and homeless children, fought to prevent child abuse, taught children to read, created inner-city parks and playgrounds and granted college scholarships, including one to the Juilliard School.\nAt a 1988 Madison Square Garden concert, Houston earned more over $250,000 for the United Negro College Fund (UNCF).\nHouston donated all of the earnings from her 1991 Super Bowl XXV performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" sales to Gulf War servicemen and their families. The record label followed suit and she was voted to the American Red Cross Board of Directors as a result. Following the terrorist attacks in 2001, Houston re-released \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to support the New York Firefighters 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Fraternal Order of Police. She waived her royalty rights to the song, which reached number one on charts in October 2001 and generated more than $1 million.\nHouston declined to perform in apartheid-era South Africa in the 1980s. Her participation at the 1988 Freedomfest performance in London (for a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela) grabbed the attention of other musicians and the media.\nIn addition, Houston became an activist for the fight against HIV and AIDS during the first decade of the AIDS epidemic. The Whitney Houston Foundation for Children, in particular, focused on helping children who suffered from HIV/AIDS, among other issues. In 1990, Whitney took part in Arista Records' 15th anniversary gala, which was an AIDS benefit, where she sang \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\", \"Greatest Love of All\" and, with cousin Dionne Warwick, \"That's What Friends Are For\". A year later, Whitney participated in the Reach Out & Touch Someone AIDS vigil at London in September 1991 while she was finishing her historic ten-date residency at London's Wembley Arena; there, she stressed the importance of AIDS research and addressing HIV stigma.\nNoting of her influence as a gay icon, during the middle of her tour to promote the My Love Is Your Love album in June 1999, Whitney gave a surprise performance at the 13th Annual New York City Lesbian & Gay Pride Dance, titled Dance 13: The Last Dance of the Century, at one of the city's West Side piers. According to Instinct magazine, Houston's unannounced performance at the Piers \"ushered in a new era that would eventually make high-profile artists performing at LGBTQ events virtually commonplace.\" Before hitting the stage, Houston was asked by MTV veejay John Norris why she decided to attend the event, Houston replied, \"we're all God's children, honey\".\n\nDocumentaries and portrayals\nDocumentaries\nSince Houston's sudden death in 2012, her life, career and death have been the subject of many documentaries and specials. A television documentary film entitled Whitney: Can I Be Me aired on Showtime on August 25, 2017. The film was directed by Nick Broomfield. \nOn April 27, 2016, it was announced that Kevin Macdonald would work with the film production team Altitude, producers of the Amy Winehouse documentary film Amy (2015), on a new documentary film based on Houston's life and death. It is the first documentary authorized by Houston's estate. That film, entitled Whitney, premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival and was released internationally in theaters on July 6, 2018.\nLifetime released the documentary Whitney Houston & Bobbi Kristina: Didn't We Almost Have It All in 2021, which The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called \"...less an expos\u00e9 and more a loving tribute to these two women\". On the tenth anniversary of her death, ESPN ran a thirty-minute documentary of Houston's acclaimed performance of The Star Spangled Banner at Super Bowl XXV in 1991 titled Whitney's Anthem.\n\nPortrayals\nIn 2015, Lifetime premiered the biographical film Whitney, which mentions that Whitney Houston was named after prominent television actress Whitney Blake, the mother of Meredith Baxter, star of the television series Family Ties. The film was directed by Houston's Waiting to Exhale co-star Angela Bassett, and Houston was portrayed by model Yaya DaCosta.\nIn April 2020, it was announced that a biopic based on Houston's life, said to be \"no holds barred\", titled I Wanna Dance with Somebody, would be produced, with Bohemian Rhapsody screenwriter Anthony McCarten writing the script and director Kasi Lemmons at the helm. Clive Davis, the Houston estate and Primary Wave were behind the biopic, with Sony Pictures & TriStar Pictures. On December 15, 2020, it was announced that actress Naomi Ackie had been picked to portray Houston. The film opened on December 23, 2022 and grossed around $60 million, becoming one of the highest grossing biopics based on a historical African American female figure after the Tina Turner biopic, What's Love Got to Do with It.\nEach actress listed portrays Houston:\n\nWhitney \u2013 Yaya DaCosta, 2015\nBobbi Kristina \u2013 Demetria McKinney, 2017\nThe Bobby Brown Story \u2013 Gabrielle Dennis, 2018\nSelena: The Series \u2013 Shaunt\u00e8 Massard, 2021 (S2, E6)\nI Wanna Dance with Somebody \u2013 Naomi Ackie, 2022\n\nDiscography\nWhitney Houston (1985)\nWhitney (1987)\nI'm Your Baby Tonight (1990)\nMy Love Is Your Love (1998)\nJust Whitney (2002)\nOne Wish: The Holiday Album (2003)\nI Look to You (2009)\n\nFilmography\nThe Bodyguard (1992)\nWaiting to Exhale (1995)\nThe Preacher's Wife (1996)\nCinderella (1997)\nSparkle (2012)\nWhitney: Can I Be Me (2017)\nWhitney (2018)\n\nTours\nHeadlining tours\nUS Summer Tour (1985)\nThe Greatest Love World Tour (1986)\nMoment of Truth World Tour (1987\u20131988)\nFeels So Right Tour (1990)\nI'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour (1991)\nThe Bodyguard World Tour (1993\u20131994)\nPacific Rim Tour (1997)\nThe European Tour (1998)\nMy Love Is Your Love World Tour (1999)\nNothing but Love World Tour (2009\u20132010)\nAn Evening with Whitney: The Whitney Houston Hologram Tour (2020\u20132023)\n\nCo-headlining tours\nSoul Divas Tour (2004)\n\nSee also\nList of awards and nominations received by Whitney Houston\nHonorific nicknames in popular music\nList of artists who reached number one in the United States\nList of artists who reached number one on the U.S. dance chart\nList of bestselling music artists\nList of best-selling gospel music artists\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAmmons, Kevin; Bacon, Nancy (1998).

It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event\u2014their first World Cup\u2014automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\nArgentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4\u20132 on penalties following a 3\u20133 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Mbapp\u00e9 also became the first player to score in two consecutive finals since Vava of Brazil did the same in 1958 and 1962. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, for some commentators fulfilling a previously unmet criterion to be regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. Teammates Emiliano Mart\u00ednez and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal. Morocco became the first African nation to top Group stages with 7 points.\nThe choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women, and members of the LGBT community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.\n\nFormat\nThe FIFA World Cup is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by FIFA. The tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay, and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event. The tournament was contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams. The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4\u20132 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final. The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length, from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar. Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world. Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.\n\nSchedule\nUnlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity, the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December. As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.\nThe match schedule was confirmed by FIFA on 15 July 2020. The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament. The final was played on 18 December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium. Unlike previous tournaments where the match venues and kick-off times for each fixture were set prior to the draw, the assignment of group fixtures for each matchday to a specific venue and kick-off time was only made after the final draw, with the teams of each specific fixture known. This was due to the close proximity of the venues, which allowed the organizers to optimize stadium allocation for spectators and kick-off times for television audiences.\nThe matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:\n\nGroups A, B, E, F: Al Bayt Stadium, Khalifa International Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium\nGroups C, D, G, H: Lusail Stadium, Stadium 974, Education City Stadium, Al Janoub Stadium\nFIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.\n\nPrize money\nIn April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440 million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.\n\nRule changes\nThe tournament featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time. In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution did not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions. Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.\n\nHost selection\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest. Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings, and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.\nAfter UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022. There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments. Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes. The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having \"high operational risk\", generated criticism from media commentators. It was criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals, which led to the 2015 FIFA corruption case.\nThe voting patterns were as follows:\n\nCost of hosting the tournament\nAt an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8 billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.\n\nVenues\nThe first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. Qatar intended that the stadiums should reflect its history and culture, and for the designs to meet the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility, and sustainability. The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that aim to reduce temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F).\nTheir marketing included statements describing the stadiums as zero waste, and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure. Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners. The Al Bayt and Al Wakrah stadiums were the only indoor stadiums of the eight used.\n\nIn an April 2013 report by Merrill Lynch, the organisers in Qatar requested that FIFA approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned. By April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have readied in five years' time. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) said it expected there would be eight in and near Doha, with the exception of Al Khor.\nEight stadiums in five Qatarian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Qatar were announced as hosts) and 2022, seven of the eight stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the Khalifa International Stadium was renovated for the tournament.\n\nAl Khor: Al Bayt Stadium (new). The first piles were driven into the ground in 2014. On 30 November 2021 it hosted its first match.\nLusail: Lusail Stadium (new). The construction of the stadium was started on 11 April 2017. It was completed on 21 November 2021.\nAl Rayyan: Ahmad bin Ali Stadium (new). The stadium was built on the demolished former stadium site. It was commissioned on 18 December 2020.\nAl Rayyan: Education City Stadium (new).  It was completed on 15 June 2020.\nAl Rayyan: Khalifa International Stadium (heavily renovated). The largest stadium in the country at the time, it was closed for renovation in 2013. It was commissioned in May 2017.\nDoha: Al Thumama Stadium (new). Construction was completed on 21 October 2021.\nDoha: Stadium 974 (temporary). Construction commenced in 2018. It was completed on 30 November 2021 and had hosted some of the matches in 2021 FIFA Arab Cup.\nAl Wakrah: Al Janoub Stadium (new). Construction officially started in 2014 and was completed on 16 May 2019.\nOf these eight stadiums, all but one have since been either dismantled, or have been moderately or heavily modified. The Stadium 974 is no longer in use and is slated for dismantled after the tournament\u2014this stadium was the first temporary stadium ever used for a FIFA World Cup. Lusail Stadium, Al Bayt Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, Education City Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium and Al Janoub Stadium will been moderately or heavily modified as reduce their capacity by half. The Khalifa International Stadium is the only largely unmodified stadium that was used for this tournament.\n\nStadiums\nTeam base camps \nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In July 2022, FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for each participating team. This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition in 1930, with 24 of the 32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha area. It was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.\n\nSecurity\nThe Qatari government employed about 50,000 security personnel including police departments and military forces from at least thirteen countries, including Poland, Germany, France, Kuwait, Jordan, Italy, Palestine, Spain, Pakistan, Turkey, USA, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. The Turkish government provided about 3,000 riot police personnel, whilst Pakistan provided about 4,500 Army troops to Qatar for the event.\n\nTeams\nQualification\nFIFA's six continental confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead. France, the reigning World Cup champions, qualified for the event through European qualification.\nSaint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before the OFC qualification draw due to travel restrictions following the pandemic. Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami. Due to COVID-19 outbreaks in their squads, Vanuatu and Cook Islands also withdrew because of the travel restrictions.\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018. Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since Italy in 1934. The Netherlands, Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, and the United States returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 tournament. Canada returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in 1986. Wales made their first appearance in 64 years\u2014the longest-ever gap for any team, their only previous participation having been in 1958.\nItaly, four-time winners and reigning European champions, failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the qualification play-off semi-finals. The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the FIFA Men's World Rankings that failed to qualify. Italy were also the fourth team to have failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup after having won the previous UEFA European Championship, following Czechoslovakia in 1978, Denmark in 1994, and Greece in 2006. The previous World Cup hosts, Russia, were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nChile, the 2015 and 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica winners, failed to qualify for the second consecutive time. Nigeria were defeated by Ghana on away goals in Confederation of African Football (CAF) final playoff round, having qualified for the previous three World Cups and six out of the last seven. Egypt, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Iceland, and Sweden, all of whom qualified for the 2018 World Cup, did not qualify for the 2022 tournament. Ghana were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 61st.\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Men's World Ranking before the tournament were:\n\nSquads\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October. Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November. In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the 2018 edition. All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for France and Iran, who chose 25 players.\n\nDraw\nThe final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in Doha, Qatar, on 1 April 2022, 19:00 AST, prior to the completion of qualification. The two winners of the inter-confederation play-offs and the winner of the Path A of the UEFA play-offs were not known at the time of the draw. The draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by Carli Lloyd, Jermaine Jenas and sports broadcaster Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of Cafu (Brazil), Lothar Matth\u00e4us (Germany), Adel Ahmed Malalla (Qatar), Ali Daei (Iran), Bora Milutinovi\u0107 (Serbia/Mexico), Jay-Jay Okocha (Nigeria), Rabah Madjer (Algeria), and Tim Cahill (Australia).\nFor the draw, 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Men's World Rankings of 31 March 2022. Pot 1 contained host Qatar (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams into pot 3. Pot 4 contained the five lowest-ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the UEFA Path A play-off winner. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group.\nThis principle also applied to the placeholder teams, with constraints applying based on the confederation of both potential winners of each play-off tie. The draw started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically. The position for the team within the group would then be drawn (for the purpose of the match schedule), with the pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group. The pots for the draw are shown below.\n\nOfficiating\nIn May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 video assistant referees for the tournament. Of the 36 referees, FIFA included two each from Argentina, Brazil, England, and France.\nFor the first time women referees officiated games at a major men's tournament. France's St\u00e9phanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan became the first female referees to be appointed to a men's World Cup. Frappart previously oversaw the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final. They were joined by three female assistant referees, Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen D\u00edaz Medina. Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the Costa Rica vs Germany match in Group E on 1 December.\nGambian referee Bakary Gassama and Argentine assistant referee Juan Pablo Belatti were among the officials to serve at their third World Cup. Belatti was an assistant referee in the 2018 final. Other returning officials included referees C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos of Mexico and Janny Sikazwe of Zambia, and Iranian assistant referee Mohammadreza Mansouri.\nOn 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that Polish referee Szymon Marciniak would adjudicate the final.\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place on Sunday, 20 November 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, prior to the opening match of the tournament between hosts Qatar and Ecuador. It included appearances by Morgan Freeman and Ghanim Al-Muftah, along with performances by South Korean singer and BTS member Jungkook and Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi. It was the first time that the Qur'an had been recited as part of the opening ceremony. During the ceremony, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani declared the tournament open.\n\nGroup stage\nThe group stage was played from 20 November to 2 December. Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, where the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage.\n\nGroup A\nThe first match of the tournament was held between Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes, but eventually won 2\u20130 with two goals from Enner Valencia. Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup. Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left. The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2\u20130 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time. Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1\u20130 ahead. Famara Di\u00e9dhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3\u20131 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games. Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute. The Netherlands won 2\u20130 against Qatar following goals by Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong to win the group, while Qatar attained the distinction of being the first home nation to lose all three group matches. Senegal faced Ecuador to determine the second knockout round qualifier. At the end of the first half, Isma\u00efla Sarr scored a penalty kick to put Senegal ahead. In the 67th minute, Mois\u00e9s Caicedo scored an equaliser, but shortly after, Kalidou Koulibaly gave Senegal the victory. The win was enough to qualify Senegal as the runners-up of Group A.\n\nGroup B\nEngland completed a 6\u20132 victory over Iran. Iranian keeper Alireza Beiranvand was removed from the game for a suspected concussion before England scored three first-half goals. Mehdi Taremi scored in the second half after which England defender Harry Maguire was also removed for a concussion. Timothy Weah, of the United States, scored a first-half goal against Wales; however, the match finished as a draw after a penalty kick was won and scored by Gareth Bale. Iran defeated Wales 2\u20130 following a red card to Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey after he committed a foul outside of his penalty area. Substitute Rouzbeh Cheshmi scored the first goal eight minutes into stoppage time, followed by Ramin Rezaeian scoring three minutes later. England and the United States played to a 0\u20130 draw, with only four shots on target between them, and one shot from Christian Pulisic hit the crossbar. England won the group following a 3\u20130 win over Wales with a goal by Phil Foden and two by Marcus Rashford. Christian Pulisic scored the winning goal as the United States defeated Iran 1\u20130 to qualify for the round of 16.\n\nGroup C\nArgentina took an early lead against Saudi Arabia after Lionel Messi scored a penalty kick after ten minutes; however, second-half goals by Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari won the match 2\u20131 for Saudi Arabia, a result the media considered one of the biggest upsets in the history of the event. The match between Mexico and Poland ended as a goalless 0\u20130 draw after Guillermo Ochoa saved Robert Lewandowski's penalty kick attempt. Lewandowski scored his first career World Cup goal in a 2\u20130 win over Saudi Arabia four days later. Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20130, with Messi scoring the opener and later assisting teammate Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez who scored his first international goal. Argentina won their last game against Poland with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, which was enough to win the group; Poland qualified for the knockout stage on goal difference, thanks to Saudi Arabia scoring an injury-time consolation goal against Mexico in a match already lost.\n\nGroup D\nThe match between Denmark and Tunisia ended as a goalless draw; both teams had goals disallowed by offside calls. Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen made his first major international appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest at the UEFA Euro 2020. Defending champions France went a goal behind to Australia, after a Craig Goodwin goal within ten minutes. France, however, scored four goals, by Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and two by Olivier Giroud to win 4\u20131. The goals tied Giroud with Thierry Henry as France's all-time top goalscorer. Mitchell Duke scored the only goal as Australia won against Tunisia. This was their first World Cup win since 2010. Mbapp\u00e9 scored a brace as France defeated Denmark 2\u20131. This was enough for France to qualify for the knockout round\u2014the first time since Brazil in 2006 that the defending champions progressed through the opening round. Mathew Leckie scored the only goal as Australia defeated Denmark 1\u20130, qualifying for the knockout round as runners-up with the win. Wahbi Khazri scored for Tunisia against France in the 58th minute. Although Antoine Griezmann equalised in stoppage time it was overturned for offside. Tunisia finished third in the group, as they required a draw in the Denmark and Australia game.\n\nGroup E\nGroup E began with Japan facing 2014 champions Germany. After an early penalty kick was converted by Germany's \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan, Japan scored two second-half goals by Ritsu D\u014dan and Takuma Asano in a 2\u20131 win. In the second group match, Spain defeated Costa Rica 7\u20130. First-half goals by Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio, and Ferran Torres were followed by goals by Gavi, Carlos Soler, Alvaro Morata, and a second by Torres. This was the largest defeat in a World Cup since Portugal's victory over North Korea in the 2010 event by the same scoreline. Costa Rica defeated Japan 1\u20130, with Keysher Fuller scoring with Costa Rica's first shot on target of the tournament. Germany and Spain drew 1\u20131, with \u00c1lvaro Morata scoring for Spain and Niclas F\u00fcllkrug scoring for Germany. Morata scored the opening goal for Spain against Japan as they controlled the first half of the match. Japan equalised on Ritsu Doan before a second goal by Ao Tanaka was heavily investigated by VAR for the ball potentially being out of play. The goal was awarded, and Japan won the group following a 2\u20131 win. Serge Gnabry scored on ten minutes for Germany against Costa Rica and they led until half-time. Germany required a win, and for Japan to not win their match, or for both teams to win their matches by a combined goal difference of at least 9 goals, to qualify. In the second half, goals by Yeltsin Tejeda and Juan Vargas gave Costa Rica a 2\u20131 lead, which would have qualified them into the knockout stages ahead of Spain. Germany scored three further goals\u2014two by Kai Havertz and a goal by Niclas Fullkrug, ending in a 4\u20132 win for Germany\u2014which was not enough to qualify them for the final stages. This was the second time in a row that the four-time champions failed to progress past the group stages. Japan won the group ahead of Spain.\n\nGroup F\nGroup F's first match was a goalless draw between Morocco and Croatia. Canada had a penalty kick in the first half of their match against Belgium which was saved by Thibaut Courtois. Belgium won the match by a single goal by Michy Batshuayi. Belgium lost 2\u20130 to Morocco, despite Morocco having a long-range direct free kick goal by Hakim Ziyech overturned for an offside on another player in the lead up to the goal. Two second-half goals from Zakaria Aboukhlal and Romain Sa\u00efss helped the Morocco win their first World Cup match since 1998. The match sparked riots in Belgium, with fires and fireworks being set off by residents. Alphonso Davies scored Canada's first World Cup goal to give Canada the lead over Croatia. Goals by Marko Livaja, Lovro Majer, and two by Andrej Kramari\u0107 for Croatia completed a 4\u20131 victory. Morocco scored two early goals through Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri in their game against Canada and qualified following a 2\u20131 victory. Canada's only goal was an own goal by Nayef Aguerd. Croatia and Belgium played a goalless draw which eliminated Belgium, whose team was ranked second in the world, from the tournament.\n\nGroup G\nBreel Embolo scored the only goal in Switzerland's 1\u20130 defeat of Cameroon. Richarlison scored two goals as Brazil won against Serbia, with star player Neymar receiving an ankle injury. Cameroon's Jean-Charles Castelletto scored the opening goal against Serbia, but they were quickly behind as Serbia scored three goals by Strahinja Pavlovi\u0107, Sergej Milinkovi\u0107-Savi\u0107, and Aleksandar Mitrovi\u0107 either side of half time. Cameroon, however, scored goals through Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, completing a 3\u20133 draw. An 83rd-minute winner by Casemiro for Brazil over Switzerland was enough for them to qualify for the knockout stage. Having already qualified, Brazil were unable to win their final group game, as they were defeated by Cameroon 1\u20130 following a goal by Vincent Aboubakar. Already having a yellow card, he was later sent off for removing his shirt in celebrating the goal. Cameroon, however, did not qualify, as Switzerland defeated Serbia 3\u20132.\n\nGroup H\nUruguay and South Korea played to a goalless draw. A goalless first half between Portugal and Ghana preceded a penalty converted by Cristiano Ronaldo to give Portugal the lead. In scoring the goal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. Ghana responded with a goal by Andr\u00e9 Ayew before goals by Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, and Rafael Le\u00e3o by Portugal put them 3\u20131 ahead. Osman Bukari scored in the 89th minute to trail by a single goal, while I\u00f1aki Williams had a chance to equalise for Ghana ten minutes into stoppage time, but slipped before shooting. The match finished 3\u20132 to Portugal. Ghanaian Mohammed Salisu opened the scoring against South Korea, with Mohammed Kudus following it up. In the second half, Cho Gue-sung scored a brace for South Korea, levelling the score. Mohammed Kudus scored again in the 68th minute, winning the match 3\u20132 for Ghana. Portugal defeated Uruguay 2\u20130 with two goals from Bruno Fernandes, advancing them to the knockout stage. A controversial penalty decision was called late in the game, with a suspected handball from Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez. Portugal led South Korea through Ricardo Horta after 10 minutes. However, goals by Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Hee-chan won the match 2\u20131 for South Korea. Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored two goals as Uruguay defeated Ghana 2\u20130. However, with South Korea winning, Uruguay required another goal to progress as they finished third on goals scored. Several Uruguay players left the pitch after the game surrounding the referees and followed them off the pitch.\n\nKnockout stage\nIn the knockout stage, if the scores were equal when normal playing time expired, extra time was played for two periods of 15 minutes each. This was followed, if required, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.\n\nBracket\nRound of 16\nThe round of 16 was played from 3 to 7 December, which for the first time ever included teams from the Americas and four other continents. Group A winners Netherlands scored goals through Memphis Depay, Daley Blind, and Denzel Dumfries as they defeated the United States 3\u20131, with Haji Wright scoring for the United States. Messi scored his third of the tournament alongside Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez to give Argentina a two-goal lead over Australia, and despite an Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez own goal from a Craig Goodwin shot, Argentina won 2\u20131. Olivier Giroud's goal and Mbapp\u00e9's brace enabled France to have a 3\u20131 victory over Poland, with Robert Lewandowski scoring the lone goal for Poland from a penalty. England beat Senegal 3\u20130, with goals coming from Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane, and Bukayo Saka. Daizen Maeda scored for Japan against Croatia in the first half before a leveller from Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 in the second. Neither team could find the winner, with Croatia defeating Japan 3\u20131 in a penalty shoot-out. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Neymar, Richarlison, and Lucas Paquet\u00e1 all scored for Brazil, but a volley from South Korean Paik Seung-ho reduced the deficit to 4\u20131. Pablo Sarabia had the best chance for Spain to break the deadlock against Morocco in stoppage time after two goalless hours, but he hit the goalie's right-hand post after a shot from the left; Morocco won the match 3\u20130 on penalties. A hat-trick by Gon\u00e7alo Ramos led Portugal to defeat Switzerland 6\u20131, with goals from Portugal's Pepe, Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro, and Rafael Le\u00e3o and from Switzerland's Manuel Akanji.\n\nQuarter-finals\nThe quarter-finals were played on 9 and 10 December. Croatia and Brazil ended 0\u20130 after 90 minutes and went to extra time. Neymar scored for Brazil in the 15th minute of extra time. Croatia, however, equalised through Bruno Petkovi\u0107 in the second period of extra time. With the match tied, a penalty shootout decided the contest, with Croatia winning the shootout 4\u20132. In the second quarter-final match, Nahuel Molina and Messi scored for Argentina before Wout Weghorst equalised with two goals shortly before the end of the game. The match went to extra time and then penalties, where Argentina would go on to win 4\u20133. Morocco defeated Portugal 1\u20130, with Youssef En-Nesyri scoring at the end of the first half. Morocco became the first African and the first Arab nation to advance as far as the semi-finals of the competition. Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2\u20131 by virtue of goals from Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.\n\nSemi-finals\nThe semi-finals were played on 13 and 14 December. Messi scored a penalty kick before Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez scored twice to give Argentina a 3\u20130 victory over Croatia. Th\u00e9o Hernandez scored after five minutes as France led Morocco for most of the game. Randal Kolo Muani scored in the 78th minute to complete a 2\u20130 victory for France over Morocco as they reached their second consecutive final.\n\nThird place play-off\nThe third place play-off was played on 17 December. The two teams had played against each other in their opening game in Group F which finished 0\u20130. Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol promptly scored for Croatia, with Achraf Dari equalising just 2 minutes later. Mislav Or\u0161i\u0107 scored the winner for Croatia as the match finished 2\u20131. Morocco earned 4th place, a record for the team and the best World Cup finish of any African or Arab nation.\n\nFinal\nThe final was played on 18 December between Argentina and France. Both teams had won the event twice previously. Early goals from Lionel Messi and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda gave Argentina, leading 2\u20130, a head start against the French. Despite substitutions in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. Mbapp\u00e9 scored the penalty and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores. With the score tied at two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute, once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbapp\u00e9 was awarded a second penalty in the 115th minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbapp\u00e9 scored his third goal, becoming the second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966. With the score tied at 3\u20133, the match was determined via a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4\u20132. This marked their third World Cup win and their first since 1986.\n\nStatistics\nGoalscorers\nThere were 172 goals scored in 64 matches, for an average of 2.69 goals per match.\nTwo own goals were scored throughout the tournament.\nThis was the most goals ever scored at a FIFA World Cup.\n8 goals\n\n7 goals\n\n4 goals\n\n3 goals\n\n2 goals\n\n1 goal\n\n1 own goal\n\nDiscipline\nA player or team official is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\n\nReceiving a red card (red card suspensions may be extended for serious offences)\nReceiving two yellow cards in two matches; yellow cards expire after the completion of the quarter-finals (yellow card suspensions are not carried forward to any other future international matches)\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\n\nAwards\nThe following World Cup awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: the Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper).\n\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament's best. The award was won by Brazil's Richarlison for his second goal in the group stage match against Serbia.\n\nMarketing\nBranding\nThe official emblem was designed by Unlock Brands and unveiled in September 2019, during simultaneous events at the Doha Tower, Katara Cultural Village amphitheatre, Msheireb Downtown Doha, and Zubarah. It is based on a shawl (reflecting upon the tournament's late-Autumn scheduling) and desert dunes, and was shaped to resemble the tournament trophy, the infinity symbol, and the number \"8\"\u2014reflecting upon the \"interconnected\" event and the eight host stadiums. The typography of the emblem's wordmark incorporated kashida\u2014the practice of elongating certain parts of characters in Arabic script to provide typographical emphasis.\nH.E Ambassador Dr. Hend Al-Muftah, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained to WIPO Magazine that the tournament provided an opportunity to \"promote our culture and showcase our signature hospitality in a multicultural environment\", and highlighted that the country has used sports to demonstrate its \"commitment to sustainable development, social inclusion and the values of community and mutual respect among peoples from different cultures and nations.\"\n\nMerchandise\nElectronic Arts' licensed video games FIFA Mobile and FIFA 23 (except on Nintendo Switch) received free updates with tie-in content for the 2022 World Cup on 8 and 9 November 2022, respectively. The update for FIFA 23 added World Cup-themed tournament modes with all teams and two of the stadiums from the event, campaigns and World Cup-themed unlockable content for Ultimate Team mode, and real-time squad and fixture updates during the tournament.\nOn 24 August 2022, the Panini Group produced themed stickers and a sticker album for a 14th consecutive World Cup. This year, rare cards with coloured borders were included and could be collected, traded, or sold.\nOn 12 April 2022, FIFA released an over-the-top media service and app revolving around the World Cup called FIFA+, where fans could play games, predict matches, and compete with others.\n\nBroadcasting rights\nIn May 2022, Infantino projected that the 2022 FIFA World Cup could be the most-watched in its history, with a global audience of at least 5 billion. The 2018 tournament was seen by 3.57 billion across the tournament. The various controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar led to questions over how the tournament would be covered in the media, and whether they would be discussed or addressed during coverage. The match between England and the United States in the group stage was seen by approximately 20 million viewers across both Fox and Telemundo, ranking among the highest-rated associated football broadcasts in the United States (behind a 2014 World Cup match that drew 24.7 million).\n\nSponsorship\nSymbols\nMascot\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is La\u02bceeb (Arabic: \u0644\u0639\u064a\u0628, romanized: La\u02bf\u012bb), which is an Arabic word meaning \"super-skilled player\". The official website of FIFA says: \"La\u02bceeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes\", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, \"a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone\".\n\nMatch ball\nThe official match ball, \"Al Rihla\", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word Al-Rihla (\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0651\u062d\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629 ar-ri\u1e25la) means \"the journey\". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As \"the game is getting faster\" and \"speeds up\", the Adidas ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second and it has to be charged before each game. Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and Qatar Airways on a SpaceX falcon 9 suborbital mission for promoting the World Cup.\nThe match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the Adidas Al Hilm (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0644\u0645, romanized: al-\u1e25ulm, lit.\u2009'the dream', a reference to \"every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup\"). Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design, a reference to the national colors of host nation Qatar and the golden colors shared by the Final's venue and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.\n\nMusic\nFor the first time, a multi-song FIFA World Cup official soundtrack has been released, instead of one official song. The first song of the album is \"Hayya Hayya (Better Together)\", performed by Trinidad Cardona, Davido, and AISHA, released on 1 April 2022 along with the music video. The second song is \"Arhbo\", performed by Gims and Ozuna, released on 19 August 2022 along with the music video. The third song is \"The World Is Yours to Take\" performed by American rapper Lil Baby, released on 23 September 2022 along with a music video. The fourth song is \"Light The Sky\" performed by Nora Fatehi, Manal, Rahma Riad, and Balqees, composed by RedOne and released on 7 October 2022 along with the music video.\nA fifth song, \"Tukoh Taka\", performed by Nicki Minaj, Maluma and Myriam Fares, was released on 17 November 2022 along with the music video, serving as the official song of the FIFA Fan Festival. The final song is \"Dreamers\" by Jungkook of BTS released on 20 November 2022. It was performed with Fahad Al-Kubaisi during the tournament's opening ceremony.\n\nControversies\nCriticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar's human-rights record, namely their treatment of migrant workers, women, and position on LGBT rights, leading to allegations of sportswashing. Others cited Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption. Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players, with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \"mistake\". The FIFA World Cup delivered record-breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets. In June 2023, Le Point revealed that FIFA World Cup has raised great interest in the country despite \"calls for a boycott\". According to the study by Arcom, six out of ten French people followed at least one match.\n\nHost selection criticism\nThere have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA's executive committee members. These allegations are being investigated by FIFA (see \u00a7 Bidding corruption allegations, 2014, below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption were made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.\"\nIn May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used \"black ops\", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights. Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in 2010.\nIn September 2018, a delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA's president to reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities.\nQatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to \"forced labour\" and poor working conditions, while many migrant workers reported having to pay large \"recruitment fees\" to obtain employment. The Guardian newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water, had their identity papers taken away from them, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves. The Guardian estimated that up to 4,000 workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held. Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system. Furthermore, in November 2017, the International Labour Organization concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against Qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers' rights. According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years.\nQatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup \u2013 the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.\nDue to Qatar's laws on alcohol consumption, World Cup organisers announced the creation of designated \"sobering-up\" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup. Qatar's World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans' safety. If a fan was sent to the \"sobering up\" zone, they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour. Multiple news agencies described the controversy as a \"cultural clash\" between social conservatism and Islamic morality against the \"norms\" of secular Western liberal democracies.\nA number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event. Issues regarding from human rights, worker conditions, the rights of LGBT fans, and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar. In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of pride flags at tournament venues, although the country still advised LGBT attendees to comply with the country's modesty and avoid public displays of affection. Hassan Abdulla al-Thawadi, chief executive of the country's World Cup bid, said that Qatar would permit alcohol consumption during the event, even though drinking in public was not permitted. There were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages. Normally, the sale of alcohol is restricted to non-Muslim guests at selected luxury hotels only. However, in the months preceding the tournament, the display of LGBT material and the sale of alcohol were banned.\nThe climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to November and December. In May 2014, Sepp Blatter, who was FIFA president at the time of the selection, remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a \"mistake\" because of the extreme heat. While addressing delegates from African and Asian confederations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including those from sponsors, were \"very much linked to racism and discrimination\". The attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.\nPrior to the tournament, a reporter for Denmark's TV 2 was threatened by security during a live report from the Katara Cultural Village; the organising committee apologised, stating that they were \"mistakenly interrupted\". Tony O'Donoghue of Ireland's RT\u00c9 also accused Qatari police of interrupting him while filming.\nOn 5 November 2022, The Sunday Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an investigation reporting that a group from an Indian hacking company had compromised the email accounts of various politicians, reporters, and other prominent individuals that had been critical of Qatar's hosting of the World Cup. It was also reported that the group had been hired by Jonas Rey, private investigators based in Switzerland, which were in turn hired by Qatari officials.\n\nMigrant workers\nThere was criticism regarding the state of human rights in Qatar and of the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths. On 23 October 2022, an article published by The Guardian included statements from migrants working on the event infrastructure. Surveying 1,000 workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable. Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the Kafala system.\nAccording to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, \"the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.\"\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament. Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.\n\nMove to November and December\nOwing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July. In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022, to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.\nThe notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the event to Qatar was a \"blatant mistake\".\nFrank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme. In 2015, FIFA confirmed that the final would be played in December. Critics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.\n\nBidding corruption allegations, 2014\nSome allegations were made over the role of former football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid. A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5 million by Qatar. She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials. In March 2014, it was discovered that former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2 million from a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign.\nThe Sunday Times published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents. Five of FIFA's six primary sponsors, Sony, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola, called upon FIFA to investigate the claims. Jim Boyce, vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven. FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Blatter said it was fueled by racism in the British media.\nIn the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Swiss officials, operating under information from the United States Department of Justice, arrested many senior FIFA officials in Z\u00fcrich and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150 million corruption and bribery scandal. From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas. In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.\nFollowing the corruption case, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup. In an interview published on the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled.\"\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids. At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process. Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is \"materially incomplete\" and contains \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\".\nIn 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg claimed to have obtained the report and wrote that it \"does not provide proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought\" and stated that he would publish the full report. This forced FIFA to release the original report. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of the 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested the rules of conduct to the limit.\n\nRussian participation\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators. The Russian national team were still permitted to enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. A team representing Russia, which used the Russian flag and anthem, could not participate under the WADA decision whilst the ban was active. The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and on 17 December 2020, Russian teams were banned from competing at world championships organized or sanctioned by a WADA signatory until 16 December 2022, the day before the third place play-off.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia's qualifying path\u2014Czech Republic, Poland, and Sweden\u2014announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory. Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.\nOn 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics, the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (\"RFU\"), rather than \"Russia\". The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions \"until further notice\", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLGBT and women's rights\nThere are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights criminalized. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with the security of fans, as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion. The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card at a minimum for wearing the armbands. Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone.\nSecurity officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing and flags featuring rainbows. American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it. Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, later dying at the stadium. Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They criticized the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl. In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene. An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture.\nDiscrimination against women in Qatar was also criticized. Women in Qatar have few freedoms, as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.\nQatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.\n\nInfluence of Iran\nIn November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of Iran were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in light of the Mahsa Amini protests. Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.\nIn November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, Iran International, known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup. On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium's security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran. These included t-shirts and signs with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" embedded onto them, Iran's previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of Mahsa Amini. This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran's matches at the World Cup. In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.\n\nTreatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors\nQatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the tournament. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews. Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.\nWhilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food, the Israeli government said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik was open in time for the first match. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans while harassing them. Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed. The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.\n\nAccommodation\nThe Rawdat Al Jahhaniya fan village was criticised for its overpriced \"night cabins\" (\u00a3185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations. The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan. The tent village in Al Khor was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents. The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.\n\nSee also\nFIFA World Cup\nFIFA World Cup hosts\n2021 FIFA Arab Cup\n2023 FIFA Women's World Cup\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \nPost match summary reports"], "Ground_truth": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup competition is scheduled to take place in Qatar.

Written by bandmates Brooke Ligertwood and Ben Fielding, the song refers to the promise of salvation through Jesus Christ as represented by His Holy Name. The \"genre-smashing single\" contributed to Hillsong being named Billboard's Top Christian Artist of 2017. \"What a Beautiful Name\" won two Dove Awards for Song of the Year and Worship Song of the Year in 2017. It won the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song. \"What a Beautiful Name\" was released on 6 January 2017, as the lead single from their 25th live album, Let There Be Light (2016).\n\nBackground\n\"What a Beautiful Name\" was composed in December 2015 in Sydney, Australia, for the upcoming Hillsong Conference, the annual church gathering. The scriptural foundation of the song can be found in Hebrews 1:1\u20131:4, Colossians 1:15\u20131:20 and Colossians 1:26\u20131:27.\n\nComposition\nAccording to sheet music published at Sheetmusicdirect.com by Hillsong Publishing, \"What a Beautiful Name\" is a slow ballad that consists of 68 beats per minute.

He writes that \"What a Beautiful Name\" is \"singable.\" In practice this refers to the \"small vocal range\" of the song which is \"one note over an octave.\" This translates to a song that is easy to sing and which does not strain the voice with notes that are too high or too low. He also comments that the song is written in the key of D which is \"the optimal key for both men and women.\"\n\nChart performance\n\"What a Beautiful Name\" had its worldwide digital release on 6 January 2017, and topped Billboard's Hot Christian Songs chart on 25 February. The single has held the top position for 37 weeks making it the third-longest-leading No. 1 in the 14-year history of the Hot Christian chart. The song which claims the distinction as the longest-leading No. 1 is \"Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)\" and was released by another Hillsong unit, Hillsong United. \"Oceans\" led the Hot Christian chart for 61 weeks. The song has stayed on the chart for 77 weeks, making it the third longest running song on the chart.\n\"What a Beautiful Name\" is ranked as the No. 1 song of the year for 2017 on the Christian Digital Sales chart, No. 3 on Christian Streaming Songs, and is also the No. 3 song on Christian Airplay. The song spent nine weeks as No. 1 on Christian Airplay and was Hillsong Worship's first No. 1 on the chart. What a Beautiful Name also leads the CCLI, the international licensing service for 250,000 churches.\n\"What a Beautiful Name\" is a track from Hillsong Worship's 25th live album, Let There Be Light. The album was released on 14 October 2016, and debuted as No. 1 on the Top Christian Albums chart. For 2017, Let There be Light was ranked the No. 9 of the year.\n\nAwards and accolades\nHillsong Worship was named Billboard's Top Christian Artist of 2017, as well as Top Christian Duo/Group. \"What a Beautiful Name\" earned two Dove awards, Song of the Year and Worship Song of the Year. \"What a Beautiful Name\" won the award for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song at the 60th Grammy Awards, the first for Hillsong Worship.\n\nCriticism of lyric\nTheologian and pastor John Piper criticized the song, in particular the lyric \u2018You didn\u2019t want heaven without us / So Jesus, you brought heaven down\u2019:\n\nI don\u2019t favor the lyric... It fits too easily into a theology of a God who created because he was lonely, and then saved people for the same reason. He just can\u2019t be happy without us.\nAnother pastor, Sam Storms also acknowledged criticisms of the lyric.\n\nIt\u2019s the statement: \u201cYou didn\u2019t want heaven without us.\u201d Some have argued that this line suggests that Jesus is needy, that he is, in himself, somehow deficient and less than complete and only we, his people can fill up what he lacks... But we know from numerous biblical texts that God needs nothing... he is altogether self-sufficient and independent.\nHillsong responded to the criticisms of the song with a blog by singer Ben Fielding. Fielding cited John 17:24 and other verses to defend the scriptural inspiration behind the criticized lyric.\n\nIn verse 2, we wanted to describe the love of God, who, though in need of nothing, so loved the world that He chose to send His one and only Son, so that we may not perish but have eternal life with Him.\n\nLive performances\nThe song was recorded at a live performance at the annual Hillsong Conference in 2016. Hillsong performed the song at the 48th Annual Dove Awards held at Allen Arena in Nashville. The performance was well received and \"had audience members on their feet with their hands in the air.\"\n\nWhen asked about performing the song in an interview with Billboard's Jim Asker, Ligertwood said about the audience: \"Because the audience is part of the church and we sing these songs in church regularly, most of the people in attendance were already familiar with the tracks. As an audience, they are just super gracious and welcoming. Our mission is that the music will resonate with them. We're not really performing\u2014we're simply vessels.\nFinally, she said about performing the song: \"I guess that when I am leading the song, my voice is me, but it's also my prayer first, that I am there to serve people and link with them in the presence of God. When you connect with people, you can feel their spirits being lifted. It's really the beauty of singing something about the wonder and power of Jesus. When people connect, it's freeing for them and breaks chains and creates faith.\"\n\nOther versions\nIn July 2017, the Voices of Lee, the \"elite\" a cappella singing group, posted a video of the song to their Facebook page. The cover was an instant hit and reached the so-called viral threshold of 5 million views in two days. As of October 2017, it had amassed 33 million views. The group represents Lee University in Tennessee; the video was filmed in the school's chapel.\n\nTrack listing\nCharts\nDecade-end charts\nCertifications\nRelease history\nFurther reading\nFielding, Ben (16 May 2017). \"Scriptural Inspiration Behind the Lyrics of 'What a Beautiful Name'\".

She contributed vocals to numerous tracks and worked with many major recording artists for decades, including a duet with Mick Jagger on the Rolling Stones song \"Gimme Shelter\". Clayton is prominently featured in 20 Feet from Stardom, the Oscar-winning documentary about background singers and their contributions to the music industry.\n\nEarly life\nClayton was born in Gert Town, New Orleans, Louisiana. She was born on Christmas Day, and was given the name \"Merry\" because of the December 25th birthdate. She is the daughter of Eva B. Clayton and the Reverend A.G. Williams, Sr.\nClayton was raised in New Orleans as a Christian, and spent much of her time in her father's parish, New Zion Baptist Church. After moving to Los Angeles, she met members of the Blossoms, who convinced her to pursue a music career.\n\nCareer\nClayton's voice as a backing singer can be heard on songs by Pearl Bailey, Phil Ochs, Burt Bacharach, Tom Jones, Joe Cocker, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King, Tori Amos and on several tracks from Neil Young's debut album. Clayton is often credited as having recorded with Elvis Presley but her name does not appear in Elvis's sessionographies.\n\n1960s\nClayton began her recording career in 1962, at the age of 14. She first sang \"Who Can I Count On?\" as a duet with Bobby Darin, on his album You're the Reason I'm Living. In 1963, she recorded the first released version of \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\", the same year that Betty Everett's version reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Early in her career, Clayton performed with Ray Charles (as one of the Raelettes). At the time, Charles was the only artist her father would allow her to see at a live performance.\nClayton is best known for her 1969 duet with Mick Jagger on the Rolling Stones song \"Gimme Shelter\" (on some releases her name is misspelled as \"Mary\"). According to Jagger, the collaboration happened partially by chance: Jagger stated that the band thought, \"it'd be great to have a woman come do the\u2026 chorus.\" They called Clayton \"randomly\" in the middle of the night in Los Angeles, and she showed up to the studio \"in curlers\" and contributed her parts in a few takes, which Jagger remarked was \"pretty amazing.\" Clayton performed her parts while pregnant, soon afterward suffering a miscarriage. Clayton was actually the band's second choice for the part; The Stones had asked Bonnie Bramlett to sing on the song, but Bramlett's husband Delaney Bramlett refused to let her perform with the Stones.\n\n1970s\nIn 1970, Clayton recorded her own version of \"Gimme Shelter\", and it became the title track of her debut solo album, released that year. Her solo version peaked at No. 73 on the pop charts. Her version would be the first of five singles under her name to crack the Billboard Hot 100. That same year, she performed a live version of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" for the soundtrack for the Robert Altman film, Brewster McCloud, and also contributed vocals to Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's film, Performance.\nIn 1971, she co-wrote the song \"Sho' Nuff\" about her mother.\nIn 1972, she starred as the original Acid Queen in the first London production of The Who's Tommy.\nIn 1973, Clayton featured prominently on Ringo Starr's \"Oh My My\", which reached Billboard's Top 10 the following year.\nAlong with her frequent partner Clydie King, Clayton also sang backing vocals on Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Sweet Home Alabama\".\nIn the mid-1970s Clayton sang on The Blackbyrds' R&B hit \"Rock Creek Park\", and continued to release solo albums throughout the next decade, notching several minor R&B chart singles.\n\n1980s\nClayton's soundtrack work continued into the 1980s, including \"You're Always There When I Need You\", the title track for the 1980 Get Smart film, The Nude Bomb, and the song \"Yes\" from Dirty Dancing, which hit No. 45 on the Hot 100.\nIn the mid-1980s, Clayton was in the gospel group Brilliance, formed by Della Reese. They released an album on Atlanta International Records in 1986.\nIn 1987, Clayton co-starred with Ally Sheedy in the film Maid to Order. That same year, she also played the character \"Verna Dee Jordan\" in the final season of Cagney & Lacey.\nIn 1989, Clayton recorded a cover version of \"Almost Paradise\" with Eric Carmen.\n\n1990s and later years\nIn 1994, Clayton sang backing vocals and also the \"Man with the Golden Gun\" bridge for Tori Amos's hit, \"Cornflake Girl\".\nIn 2006, Clayton provided backing vocals for Sparta's album Threes, on the songs \"Atlas\" and \"Translations\". In 2013, she released The Best of Merry Clayton, a compilation of her favorite songs.\nClayton was featured in the documentary film 20 Feet from Stardom (2013), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and went on to win the Oscar for best documentary at the 86th Academy Awards. 20 Feet from Stardom also won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Music Film, with the award being presented to the featured artists, in addition to the production crew for the film.\nIn 2014, Clayton provided vocals for G. Love & Special Sauce's album Sugar and in 2015, she was featured on two tracks of Coldplay's album A Head Full of Dreams.\nIn 2021, her solo album Beautiful Scars was released.\n\nPersonal life\nClayton was married to jazz artist Curtis Amy from 1970 until his death in 2002. Their son, Kevin Amy, has also pursued a musical career. Her brother is Little Feat percussionist Sam Clayton.\nClayton had a miscarriage upon returning home from recording \"Gimme Shelter\", according to the Los Angeles Times.\nOn June 16, 2014, Clayton was critically injured and almost died after being involved in a car crash in Los Angeles, California that caused both of her legs to be  amputated at the knees due to her suffering \"profound trauma to her lower extremities.\"\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nCompilation albums\nSingles (selected)\nFilmography\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nMerry Clayton at IMDb\nMerry Clayton at AllMusic \nMerry Clayton discography at Discogs \nMerry Clayton fansite with brief biography, full discography, full released guest appearances, all with music streaming links, filmography, gigography, videos, pictures, articles, links etc.\nMerry Clayton's solo-version of \"Gimme Shelter\" (1970)"], "Ground_truth": "Female vocals on the 1969 recorded song \"Gimme Shelter,\" by The Rolling Stones, are performed by Merry Clayton.

According to the New Testament, he was a fisherman and one of the Twelve Apostles chosen by Jesus. The title First-Called (\u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, Pr\u014dtokl\u0113tos) stems from the Gospel of John, where Andrew, initially a disciple of John the Baptist, follows Jesus and, recognizing him as the Messiah, introduces his brother Simon Peter to him.\nAccording to Eastern Orthodox tradition, the apostolic successor to Andrew is the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nLife\nEarly life\nThe name \"Andrew\" (meaning manly, brave, from Greek: \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, translit. andre\u00eda, lit. \"manhood, valour\"), like other Greek names, appears to have been common among the Jews and other Hellenized people since the second or third century B.C. No Hebrew or Aramaic name is recorded for him.\nAndrew the Apostle was born between 5 and 10 AD in Bethsaida, in Galilee. The New Testament states that Andrew was the brother of Simon Peter, and likewise a son of Jonah. \"The first striking characteristic of Andrew is his name: it is not Hebrew, as might have been expected, but Greek, indicative of a certain cultural openness in his family that cannot be ignored. We are in Galilee, where the Greek language and culture are quite present.\"\n\nWith Jesus\nBoth he and his brother Peter were fishermen by trade and also Simon Peter who became a \"fisher of men\", hence the tradition that Jesus called them to be his disciples by saying that he will make them \"fishers of men\" (Greek: \u1f01\u03bb\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd, translit. halie\u00ees anthr\u1e53p\u014dn). According to Mark 1:29, at the beginning of Jesus' public life, they occupied the same house at Capernaum.\nIn the Gospel of Matthew and in the Gospel of Mark Simon Peter and Andrew were both called together to become disciples of Jesus and \"fishers of men\". These narratives record that Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, observed Simon and Andrew fishing, and called them to discipleship.\nIn the parallel incident in the Gospel of Luke Andrew is not named, nor is reference made to Simon having a brother. In this narrative, Jesus initially used a boat, solely described as being Simon's, as a platform for preaching to the multitudes on the shore and then as a means to achieving a huge trawl of fish on a night which had hitherto proved fruitless. The narrative indicates that Simon was not the only fisherman in the boat (they signalled to their partners in the other boat \u2026) but it is not until the next chapter that Andrew is named as Simon's brother. However, it is generally understood that Andrew was fishing with Simon on the night in question. Matthew Poole, in his Annotations on the Holy Bible, stressed that 'Luke denies not that Andrew was there'.\nThe Gospel of John states that Andrew was a disciple of John the Baptist, whose testimony first led him, and another unnamed disciple of John the Baptist, to follow Jesus. Andrew at once recognized Jesus as the Messiah, and hastened to introduce him to his brother. The Byzantine Church honours him with the name Protokletos, which means \"the first called\". Thenceforth, the two brothers were disciples of Christ. On a subsequent occasion, prior to the final call to the apostolate, they were called to a closer companionship, and then they left all things to follow Jesus.\nSubsequently, in the gospels, Andrew is referred to as being present on some important occasions as one of the disciples more closely attached to Jesus. Andrew told Jesus about the boy with the loaves and fishes, and when certain Greeks went to see Jesus, they came to Philip, but Philip then had recourse to Andrew. Andrew was present at the Last Supper. Andrew was one of the four disciples who came to Jesus on the Mount of Olives to ask about the signs of Jesus' return at the \"end of the age\".\n\nAfter Jesus\nEusebius in his Church History 3.1 (4th century) quoted Origen (c. 185 \u2013 c. 253) as saying that Andrew preached in Scythia. The Chronicle of Nestor (1113) adds that he preached along the Black Sea and the Dnieper river as far as Kiev, and from there he travelled to Novgorod. Hence, he became a patron saint of Ukraine, Romania and Russia. According to Hippolytus of Rome, Andrew preached in Thrace, and his presence in Byzantium is mentioned in the apocryphal Acts of Andrew. According to tradition, he founded the see of Byzantium (later Constantinople) in AD 38, installing Stachys as bishop. \nThis diocese became the seat of the Patriarchate of Constantinople under Anatolius, in 451.\nAndrew, along with Stachys, is recognized as the patron saint of the Patriarchate. Basil of Seleucia (5th century) also knew of Apostle Andrew's missions in Thrace, Scythia and Achaea.\n\nMartyrdom\nAndrew is said to have been martyred by crucifixion at the city of Patras (Patr\u00e6) in Achaea, in AD 60. Early texts, such as the Acts of Andrew known to Gregory of Tours (6th century), describe Andrew as bound, not nailed, to a Latin cross of the kind on which Jesus is said to have been crucified; yet a tradition developed that Andrew had been crucified on a cross of the form called crux decussata (X-shaped cross, or \"saltire\"), now commonly known as a \"Saint Andrew's Cross\" \u2014 supposedly at his own request, as he deemed himself unworthy to be crucified on the same type of cross as Jesus had been. The iconography of the martyrdom of Andrew \u2014 showing him bound to an X-shaped cross \u2014 does not appear to have been standardized until the later Middle Ages.\n\nThe Acts of Andrew\nThe apocryphal Acts of Andrew, mentioned by Eusebius, Epiphanius and others, is among a disparate group of Acts of the Apostles that were traditionally attributed to Leucius Charinus but it shows several signs of a mid-2nd-century origin. It describes the supposed travels of the title character, the miracles he performed during them, and finally a description of his martyrdom. Eusebius of Caesarea knew the work, which he dismissed as the product of a heretic and absurd. The Acts, as well as a Gospel of St Andrew, appear among rejected books in the Decretum Gelasianum connected with the name of Pope Gelasius I. Dennis MacDonald posits the theory that the non-canonical Acts of Andrew was a Christian retelling of Homer's Odyssey.\n\nRelics\nRelics alleged to be those of the Apostle Andrew are kept at the Basilica of Saint Andrew in Patras, Greece; in Amalfi Cathedral (the Duomo di Sant'Andrea), Amalfi and in Sarzana Cathedral in Sarzana, Italy; St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, Scotland; and the Church of St Andrew and St Albert, Warsaw, Poland. There are also numerous smaller reliquaries throughout the world.\nAndrew's remains were preserved at Patras. According to one legend, Regulus (Rule), a monk at Patras, was advised in a dream to hide some of the bones. Shortly thereafter, most of the relics were transferred from Patras to Constantinople by order of the Roman emperor Constantius II around 357 and deposited in the Church of the Holy Apostles.\nRegulus was said to have had a second dream in which an angel advised him to take the hidden relics \"to the ends of the earth\" for protection. Wherever he was shipwrecked, he was to build a shrine for them. St. Rule set sail, taking with him a kneecap, an upper arm bone, three fingers and a tooth. He sailed west, towards the edge of the known world, and was shipwrecked on the coast of Fife, Scotland. However, the relics were probably brought to Britain in 597 as part of the Augustine Mission, and then in 732 to Fife, by Bishop Acca of Hexham, a well-known collector of religious relics.\nThe skull of Saint Andrew, which had been taken to Constantinople, was returned to Patras by Emperor Basil I, who ruled from 867 to 886.\nIn 1208, following the sack of Constantinople, those relics of Saint Andrew and Saint Peter which remained in the imperial city were taken to Amalfi, Italy, by Cardinal Peter of Capua, a native of Amalfi. A cathedral was built, dedicated to Saint Andrew, as is the town itself, to house a tomb in its crypt where it is maintained that most of the relics of the apostle, including an occipital bone, remain.\nThomas Palaeologus was the youngest surviving son of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. Thomas ruled the province of Morea, the medieval name for the Peloponnese. In 1461, when the Ottomans crossed the Strait of Corinth, Palaeologus fled Patras for exile in Italy, bringing with him what was purported to be the skull of Saint Andrew. He gave the head to Pope Pius II, who had it enshrined in one of the four central piers of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and then in Pienza, Italy.\nIn September 1964, Pope Paul VI, as a gesture of goodwill toward the Greek Orthodox Church, ordered that the one relic of Saint Andrew held in Vatican City be returned to Patras. Cardinal Augustin Bea, head of the Vatican's Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity, led a delegation that presented the skull to Bishop Constantine of Patras on 24 September 1964. The cross of Saint Andrew was taken from Greece during the Crusades by the Duke of Burgundy. It was kept in the church of St. Victor in Marseilles until it returned to Patras on 19 January 1980. The cross of the apostle was presented to the Bishop of Patras Nicodemus by a Catholic delegation led by Cardinal Roger Etchegaray. All the relics, which consist of the small finger, the skull (part of the top of the cranium of Saint Andrew), and the cross on which he was martyred, have been kept in the Church of St. Andrew at Patras in a special shrine and are revered in a special ceremony every 30 November, his feast day.\nIn 2006, the Catholic Church, again through Cardinal Etchegaray, gave the Greek Orthodox Church another relic of Saint Andrew.\n\nLiturgical commemoration\nEastern Orthodoxy\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates the Apostle Andrew on several days throughout the Church Calendar. Fixed days of commemoration include:\n\n20 June - The Translation of the Relics of the Apostles Andrew, Thomas, and Luke; the Prophet Elisha; and the Martyr Lazarus.\n30 June - The Twelve Apostles.\n26 September - The Translation of the skull of Andrew in 1964.\n30 November - Primary Feast Day.\nThere are also days which are movable:\n\nThe Sunday before 30 November - Synaxis of the Saints of Achaea.\nThe Sunday of the Samaritan Woman - Synaxis of the all the Holy Fathers, Archbishops, and Patriarchs of Constantinople.\n\nRoman Catholicism\nThe Roman Catholic Church commemorates Andrew on 30 November.\n\nTraditions and legends\nGeorgia\nThe church tradition of Georgia regards Andrew as the first preacher of Christianity in the territory of Georgia and as the founder of the Georgian church. This tradition derives from Byzantine sources, particularly Nicetas of Paphlagonia (died c. 890) who asserts that \"Andrew preached to the Iberians, Sauromatians, Taurians, and Scythians and to every region and city, on the Black Sea, both north and south.\" The version was adopted by the 10th\u201311th-century Georgian ecclesiastics and, refurbished with more details, was inserted in the Georgian Chronicles. The story of Andrew's mission in the Georgian lands endowed the Georgian church with apostolic origin and served as a defence argument to George the Hagiorite against the encroachments from the Antiochian church authorities on autocephaly of the Georgian church. Another Georgian monk, Ephraim the Minor, produced a thesis, reconciling Andrew's story with an earlier evidence of the 4th-century conversion of Georgians by Nino and explaining the necessity of the \"second Christening\" by Nino. The thesis was made canonical by the Georgian church council in 1103. The Georgian Orthodox Church marks two feast days in honour of Saint Andrew, on 12 May and 13 December. The former date, dedicated to Andrew's arrival in Georgia, is a public holiday in Georgia.\n\nCyprus\nCypriot tradition holds that a ship which was transporting Andrew went off course and ran aground. Upon coming ashore, Andrew struck the rocks with his staff at which point a spring of healing waters gushed forth. Using it, the sight of the ship's captain, who had been blind in one eye, was restored. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a fortified monastery, the Apostolos Andreas Monastery, stood there in the 12th century, from which Isaac Comnenus negotiated his surrender to Richard the Lionheart. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The main monastery of the current church dates to the 18th century.\nOther pilgrimages are more recent. The story is told that in 1895, the son of a Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. As she was telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest, became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks and mother and son were thus reunited.\nApostolos Andreas Monastery (Greek: \u0391\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2) is a monastery dedicated to Saint Andrew situated just south of Cape Apostolos Andreas, which is the north-easternmost point of the island of Cyprus, in Rizokarpaso in the Karpass Peninsula. The monastery is an important site to the Cypriot Orthodox Church. It was once known as 'the Lourdes of Cyprus', served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such, it is visited by many people for votive prayers.\n\nMalta\nSt. Andrew (Sant' Andrija) is the patron saint of Luqa. The patron saint's traditional feast is celebrated on the first Sunday of July, with the liturgical feast being celebrated on 30 November. A local niche dedicated to him is found in Luqa, which is two storeys high. The first reference regards the small chapel at Luqa dedicated to Andrew dates to 1497. This chapel contained three altars, one of them dedicated to Andrew. The painting showing Mary with Saints Andrew and Paul was painted by the Maltese artist Filippo Dingli. At one time, many fishermen lived in the village of Luqa, and this may be the main reason for choosing Andrew as patron saint. The statue of Andrew was sculpted in wood by Giuseppe Scolaro in 1779. This statue underwent several restoration works including that of 1913 performed by the Maltese artist Abraham Gatt. The Martyrdom of Saint Andrew on the main altar of the church was painted by Mattia Preti in 1687.\n\nRomania\nSaint Andrew is the patron saint of Romania. The official stance of the Romanian Orthodox Church is that Andrew preached the Gospel in the province of Dobruja (Scythia Minor) to the Dacians who were similar to Thracians, whom he is said to have converted to Christianity. Such a tradition was however not widely acknowledged until the 20th century, although substantiated by the Church History of Eusebius.\nAccording to Hippolyte of Antioch, (died c. 250 C.E.) in his On Apostles, Origen in the third book of his Commentaries on the Genesis (254 C.E.), Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church History (340 C.E.), and other sources, such as Usaard's Martyrdom written between 845 and 865, and Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend (c. 1260), Andrew preached in Scythia, a possible reference to Scythia Minor, corresponding to the modern-day regions of Northern Dobruja (part of Romania) and Southern Dobruja (part of Bulgaria). According to Hippolyte of Antioch, Saint Andrew had also preached to the Thracians.\nAlthough the exclusive presence in the Romanian language of Latin vocabulary for concepts of Christian faith may indicate the antiquity of Daco-Roman Christianity, according to some modern Romanian scholars, the idea of early Christianisation (preceding the Edict of Milan) is unsustainable. They take the idea to be a part of the ideology of protochronism, which they claim to purport that the Eastern Orthodox Church has been a companion and defender of the Romanian people for its entire history, aspect supposedly used for propaganda purposes during the communist era. Historians such as Ioan-Aurel Pop consider Romanians to be the first to adopt Christianity among the peoples which now inhabit the territories bordering Romania, conversion to Christianity until the third century (in the province of Dacia Traiana, dissolved c. 271/275 AD) playing a significant part in the ethnogenesis of the Romanians.\nScholar Mircea Eliade argues in favor of structural links between Zamolxism and Christianity, thus suggesting a higher likelihood of early conversion. As such, if Andrew the Apostle had preached in Dobruja (in proximity to the Thracians he had also preached to) and not in Crimea as per the Russian Orthodox Church, Christianity in Romania can be considered of apostolic origin.\nBetween the 4th and 6th centuries, the region of Scythia Minor played an influential role in the development of Christian theology.\n\nUkraine and Russia\nTradition regarding the early Christian history of Ukraine holds that the apostle Andrew preached on the southern borders of modern-day Ukraine, along the Black Sea. A legend, recorded in the Primary Chronicle (pages 7.21\u20139.4), has it that he travelled from Sinope towards Chersonesus (Korsun), up the Dnieper River and reached the future location of Kyiv, where he erected a cross on the site where the Saint Andrew's Church of Kyiv currently stands, and where he prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city. Next, he is said to have journeyed north to the Slovenes near the future site of Veliky Novgorod, although he had a negative attitude towards their customs; then he visited Rome and returned to Sinope. Because of this connection to Kyiv and Novgorod, Andrew is considered to be the patron saint of the two East Slavic nations descended from the Kievan Rus: Ukraine and Russia, the latter country using the Saint Andrew's Cross on its naval ensign.\n\nScotland\nSeveral legends claim that the relics of Andrew were brought by divine guidance from Constantinople to the place where the modern Scottish town of St Andrews stands today (Gaelic, Cill R\u00ecmhinn). The oldest surviving manuscripts are two: one is among the manuscripts collected by Jean-Baptiste Colbert and willed to Louis XIV of France, now in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris; the other is the Harleian Mss in the British Library, London. They state that the relics of Andrew were brought by one Regulus to the Pictish king \u00d3engus mac Fergusa (729\u2013761). The only historical Regulus (Riagail or Rule) whose name is preserved in the tower of St Rule was an Irish monk expelled from Ireland with Columba; his dates, however, are c. 573 \u2013 600. There are good reasons for supposing that the relics were originally in the collection of Acca, bishop of Hexham, who took them into Pictish country when he was driven from Hexham (c. 732), and founded a see, not, according to tradition, in Galloway, but on the site of St Andrews.\n\nAccording to legendary accounts given in 16th-century historiography, \u00d3engus II in AD 832 led an army of Picts and Scots into battle against the Angles, led by \u00c6thelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that he was heavily outnumbered and hence whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, \u00d3engus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Andrew as the patron saint of Scotland. On the morning of battle white clouds forming an X shape in the sky were said to have appeared. \u00d3engus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Andrew was crucified, \u00d3engus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Andrew as the patron saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend. However, there is evidence that Andrew was venerated in Scotland before this.\n\nAndrew's connection with Scotland may have been reinforced following the Synod of Whitby, when the Celtic Church felt that Columba had been \"outranked\" by Peter and that Peter's brother would make a higher-ranking patron. The 1320 Declaration of Arbroath cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Andrew, \"the first to be an Apostle\". Numerous parish churches in the Church of Scotland and congregations of other Christian churches in Scotland are named after Andrew. The former national church of the Scottish people in Rome, Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi was dedicated to Saint Andrew.\nA local superstition uses the cross of Saint Andrew as a hex sign on the fireplaces in northern England and Scotland to prevent witches from flying down the chimney and entering the house to do mischief. By placing the Saint Andrew's cross on one of the fireplace posts or lintels, witches are prevented from entering through this opening. In this case, it is similar to the use of a witch ball, although the cross will actively prevent witches from entering, whereas the witch ball will passively delay or entice the witch, and perhaps entrap it.\nThe National Shrine of Saint Andrew is located at St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh.\n\nSpain\nSt. Andrew was the patron saint of the Dukes of Burgundy. A form of St. Andrew's cross called the Cross of Bourgogne was used as the flag of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the duchy was acquired by Spain, by the Spanish Crown, and later as a Spanish naval flag and finally as an army battle flag up until 1843. Today, it is still a part of various Spanish military insignia and forms part of the coat of arms of the king of Spain.\nIn Spain, Andrew is the patron of several locations: San Andr\u00e9s (Santa Cruz de Tenerife), San Andr\u00e9s y Sauces (La Palma), Navalmoral de la Mata (C\u00e1ceres), \u00c9ibar (Gipuzkoa), Baeza (Ja\u00e9n), Pobladura de Pelayo Garc\u00eda and Pobladura de Yuso (Le\u00f3n), Berlangas de Roa (Burgos), Lig\u00fcerzana (Palencia), Castillo de Bayuela (Toledo), Almorad\u00ed (Alicante), Estella (Navarra), Sant Andreu de Palomar, (Barcelona), Pujalt (Catalonia), Adamuz (C\u00f3rdoba) and San Andr\u00e9s in Cameros (La Rioja).\n\nLegacy\nAndrew is the patron saint of several countries and cities, including Barbados, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Ukraine, Sarzana, Pienza and Amalfi in Italy, Esgueira in Portugal, Luqa in Malta, Para\u00f1aque in the Philippines and Patras in Greece. He was also the patron saint of Prussia and of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He is considered the founder and the first bishop of the Church of Byzantium and is consequently the patron saint of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Thus, Benedict XVI calls him \"the Apostle of the Greek world,\" and since he is the brother of St. Peter, the first bishop of Rome, their brotherhood is \"symbolically expressed in the special reciprocal relations of the See of Rome and of Constantinople, which are truly Sister Churches.\"\nThe flag of Scotland (and consequently the Union Flag and those of some of the former colonies of the British Empire) feature Saint Andrew's saltire cross. The saltire is also the flag of Tenerife, the former flag of Galicia and the Russian Navy Ensign.\nThe feast of Andrew is observed on 30 November in both the Eastern and Western churches, and is a bank holiday in Scotland, \nThere are week-long celebrations in the town of St Andrews and in some other Scottish cities.\nIn the Catholic Church, Advent begins with First Vespers of the Sunday that falls on or closest to the feast of Saint Andrew. Andrew the Apostle is remembered in the Church of England with a Festival on 30 November.\n\nIn Islam\nThe Qur'anic account of the disciples of Jesus does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim exegesis, however, more or less agrees with the New Testament list and says that the disciples included Andrew.\n\nIn Art\nSt. Andrew is traditionally portrayed with a long forked beard, a cross, and a book.\nMasaccio's 1426 \"Saint Andrew\" is a panel painting in tempora and gold leaf, once part of the Pisa Altarpiece It is now at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California. Andrew appears as part of Carlo Crivelli's San Domenico Altarpiece (1476). This panel is now in the National Gallery in London.\nHans Holbein the Younger did a pen and ink drawing (c.1519) of the saint as a design for a stained glass window. It is in the Kunstmuseum Basel.\n\nSee also\nOrder of Saint Andrew\nPatron saints of places\nSaltire \u2013 the X-shaped cross in heraldry and vexillology\nSt. Andrew's Cross (disambiguation)\nSaint Andrew's Day\nUniversity of St Andrews \u2014 named after the Royal Burgh of St Andrews, which was named after the saint\nSaint Andrew the Apostle, patron saint archive\n\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

It is the largest and busiest hospital in Merseyside and Cheshire, and has the largest emergency department of its kind in the UK.\nA major redevelopment of the hospital began in 2013 and was scheduled for completion in 2017, but construction problems and the 2018 collapse of main contractor Carillion meant it did not open until late 2022.\nAlongside Broadgreen Hospital and Liverpool University Dental Hospital, the hospital is managed by the Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is associated with the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\n\nHistory\nFormer hospital\nThe former hospital, originally known simply as the Royal Liverpool Hospital, was designed to replace three other city centre acute hospitals that existed at the time \u2013 the Liverpool Royal Infirmary on Pembroke Place, the David Lewis Northern Hospital on Great Howard Street, and the Royal Southern Hospital on Caryl Street. It had been agreed to amalgamate the separate facilities on a site in close proximity to the University of Liverpool for the purposes of medical education and research. The site on which the current hospital now stands (on Prescot Street) was identified as part of the post-war regeneration of Liverpool. However, building on the main hospital did not commence until 1963. The first phase of the hospital was designed by Holford Associates and built by Alfred McAlpine between 1963 and 1969. The construction was plagued from the outset by problems of cost, time and quality, together with difficulties over fire certification due to changes in health and safety law whilst building work was ongoing. The second phase was completed and the hospital eventually opened in 1978.\n\nRedevelopment\nIn December 2013, the landmark \u00a3429 million redevelopment of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract, reached financial close; its collaborative links with the University of Liverpool, and institutes on the Liverpool BioCampus, have given the city of Liverpool recognition as one of the leading UK centres for health research and innovation. The new Royal Liverpool University Hospital, which was designed by NBBJ and HKS and was being built by Carillion, was expected to be the largest all single-patient room hospital in the UK upon its originally scheduled completion of March 2017.\nIn March 2017, the project was running more than a year late due to problems caused by asbestos, cracking concrete and bad weather, and further delays were announced in early January 2018. Less than a fortnight later, on 15 January 2018, Carillion went into liquidation, partly due to its problems with the hospital contract, and delaying the project still further, with the hospital unlikely to be finished in 2018. On 26 March 2018, it was reported that the project had been costing \u00a353.9M more than Carillion had officially reported. In September, the NHS Trust revealed that the cost of rectifying serious faults, including replacing non-compliant cladding installed by Carillion, was holding up plans to restart and finish the \u00a3350M project; with the project further delayed, the Trust was considering invoking a break clause to terminate the PFI contract. On 24 September 2018, it was reported that the government would step in to terminate the PFI deal, taking the hospital into full public ownership, meaning a \u00a3180M loss for private sector lenders Legal & General and the European Investment Bank. This was confirmed on 26 September 2018, with completion of the hospital in 2020 likely to cost an additional \u00a3120M, due to unforeseen issues left behind by Carillion.\nConstruction work was expected to resume in November 2018. On 25 October 2018 Laing O'Rourke was confirmed as the contractor to complete the project, but, a month later, with the contractor not prepared to take any risk, Mace was also appointed to help manage risks associated with the \u00a3350M scheme. In April 2019, the project was reported to be facing further delays due to subcontractors' reluctance to work on the scheme, while further defects were detected in May 2019, with rectification also likely to delay completion and increase costs.\nOn 17 December 2019, hospital CEO Steve Warburton confirmed the project had been further delayed until at least 2022 and that patients and staff would be at the existing hospital for the next three winters. In addition to \u00a3285M already spent, Warburton said completion would cost \u00a3300M, including costs to replace an aluminium composite cladding system, which, since the Grenfell Tower fire, was known to breach building regulations. In March 2020, the hospital NHS Trust revealed it was drawing up claims against Carillion's insurers and a Carillion subcontractor Heyrod Construction. In June 2020, the Portuguese manufacturer of the cladding was drafted in to remove it.\nA delayed National Audit Office report into the government's handling of the Royal Liverpool and Midland Metropolitan University Hospitals was published in January 2020. The report warned of possible further significant cost increases, particularly to rectify the badly-built Liverpool project, and blamed Carillion for pricing the jobs too low to meet specifications. The two projects were expected to cost more than 40% more than their original budgets, and to be completed between three and five years late. However, due to effective risk transfer to the contractor, the total cost to the taxpayer would be very similar to the original plan.\nPart of the new hospital was opened early in May 2020 to provide additional critical care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. In June 2022, the NHS Trust said the hospital was scheduled to open in September or October 2022. The NHS Trust took partial possession of the new building on 11 July, with a 24-day moving-in period set to run from 28 September to 21 October 2022.\nIn October 2022, the trust said that the old hospital building would permanently close at 23:59 on 19 October 2022 with the A&E department at the new site taking their first patients from 00:00 on 20 October 2022. The old hospital had 685 beds.  The new hospital has 640 beds and there are 21 \u2018transfer of care\u2019 beds opening at the nearby Broadgreen Hospital site, with a further 10 beds in the community -  a net reduction of 14 beds.\nIn January 2023, the BBC reported that senior medics at the hospital claimed to be \"embarrassed, ashamed and demoralised\" by the care they can give at the new A&E, calling the department \"overcrowded, chaotic and unpleasant\". In the same article, it is claimed that costs are expected to reach over \u00a31 billion, up from an initial estimate of \u00a3335 million.\n\nRating\nIn 2007, the Healthcare Commission rated Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust \"Good\" for 'Quality of Services' and Good for 'Use of Resources'. In 2009, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust was rated \"Excellent\" for the quality of its services and the quality of its financial management.\n\nTeaching and research\nThe Royal Liverpool University Hospital is a major teaching and research hospital for student doctors, nurses, dentists and allied health professionals. The hospital works with the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\n\nSee also\nList of hospitals in England\nKnowledge Quarter, Liverpool\nHealthcare in Merseyside\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Royal Liverpool University Hospital at Wikimedia Commons"], "Ground_truth": "Before redevelopment, the new royal liverpool hospital was opened in 1978 following the completion of the second phase of construction.

Members of the McMartin family, who operated a preschool in Manhattan Beach, California, were charged with hundreds of acts of sexual abuse of children in their care. Accusations were made in 1983, with arrests and the pretrial investigation taking place from 1984 to 1987 and trials running from 1987 to 1990. The case lasted seven years but resulted in no convictions, and all charges were dropped in 1990. By the case's end, it had become the longest and most expensive series of criminal trials in American history. The case was part of day-care sex-abuse hysteria, a moral panic over alleged Satanic ritual abuse in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nInitial allegations\nIn 1983, Judy Johnson, mother of one of the preschool's young students, reported to the police that her son had been sodomized by her estranged husband and also by McMartin teacher Ray Buckey. Buckey was the grandson of school founder Virginia McMartin and son of administrator Peggy McMartin Buckey. Johnson's belief that her son had been abused began when her son had painful bowel movements. What happened next is still disputed. Some sources state that at that time, Johnson's son denied her suggestion that his preschool teachers had molested him, whereas others say he confirmed the abuse.\nIn addition, Johnson also made several more accusations, including that people at the daycare had sexual encounters with animals, that \"Peggy drilled a child under the arms\" and \"Ray flew in the air.\" Buckey was questioned, but was not prosecuted due to lack of evidence. The police then sent a form letter to about 200 parents of students at the McMartin school, stating that their children might have been abused, and asking the parents to question their children. The text of the letter read:\n\nSeptember 8, 1983\nDear Parent:\nThis Department is conducting a criminal investigation involving child molestation (288 P.C.) Ray Buckey, an employee of Virginia McMartin's Pre-School, was arrested September 7, 1983 by this Department.\nThe following procedure is obviously an unpleasant one, but to protect the rights of your children as well as the rights of the accused, this inquiry is necessary for a complete investigation.\nRecords indicate that your child has been or is currently a student at the pre-school.  We are asking your assistance in this continuing investigation.  Please question your child to see if he or she has been a witness to any crime or if he or she has been a victim.  Our investigation indicates that possible criminal acts include: oral sex, fondling of genitals, buttock or chest area, and sodomy, possibly committed under the pretense of \"taking the child's temperature.\"  Also photos may have been taken of children without their clothing.  Any information from your child regarding having ever observed Ray Buckey to leave a classroom alone with a child during any nap period, or if they have ever observed Ray Buckey tie up a child, is important.\nPlease complete the enclosed information form and return it to this Department in the enclosed stamped return envelope as soon as possible.  We will contact you if circumstances dictate same.\nWe ask you to please keep this investigation strictly confidential because of the nature of the charges and the highly emotional effect it could have on our community.  Please do not discuss this investigation with anyone outside your immediate family.  Do not contact or discuss the investigation with Raymond Buckey, any member of the accused defendant's family, or employees connected with the McMartin Pre-School.\nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATED THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF VIRGINIA MCMARTIN'S PRE-SCHOOL HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SITUATION AND NO DETRIMENTAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE OPERATION OF THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN DISCOVERED DURING THIS INVESTIGATION.  ALSO, NO OTHER EMPLOYEE IN THE SCHOOL IS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR ANY CRIMINAL ACT.\n\nJohnson was diagnosed with and hospitalized for acute paranoid schizophrenia and, in 1986, was found dead in her home from complications of chronic alcoholism before the preliminary hearing concluded.\n\nInterviewing and examining the children\nSeveral hundred children were then interviewed by the Children's Institute International (CII), a Los Angeles-based abuse therapy clinic run by Kee MacFarlane. The interviewing techniques used during investigations of the allegations were highly suggestive and invited children to pretend or speculate about supposed events. By spring of 1984, it was claimed that 360 children had been abused. Astrid Heppenstall Heger performed medical examinations and took photos of what she believed to be minute scarring, which she stated was caused by anal penetration. Journalist John Earl believed that her findings were based on unsubstantiated medical histories. Later research demonstrated that the methods of questioning used on the children were extremely suggestive, leading to false accusations. Others believe that the questioning itself may have led to false memory syndrome among the children questioned. Only 41 of the original 360 children ultimately testified in the grand jury and pretrial hearings, and fewer than a dozen testified at the actual trials.\nMichael P. Maloney, a clinical psychologist and professor of psychiatry, reviewed videotapes of the children's interviews. Maloney, testifying as an expert witness on interviewing children, was highly critical of the techniques used, referring to them as improper, coercive, directive, problematic and adult-directed in a way that forced the children to follow a rigid script. He concluded that \"many of the kids' statements in the interviews were generated by the examiner.\" Transcripts and recordings of the interviews contained far more speech from adults than children and demonstrated that, despite the highly coercive interviewing techniques used, initially the children were resistant to interviewers' attempts to elicit disclosures. The recordings of the interviews were instrumental in the jury's refusal to convict, by demonstrating how children could be coerced to giving vivid and dramatic testimonies without having experienced actual abuse. The techniques used were shown to be contrary to the existing guidelines in California for the investigation of cases involving children and child witnesses.\n\nBizarre allegations\nSome of the accusations were described as \"bizarre\", overlapping with accusations that mirrored the emerging satanic ritual abuse panic. It was alleged that, in addition to having been sexually abused, they saw witches fly, traveled in a hot-air balloon, and were taken through underground tunnels. When shown a series of photographs by Danny Davis (the McMartins' lawyer), one child identified actor Chuck Norris as one of the abusers.\nSome of the abuse was alleged to have occurred in secret tunnels beneath the school. Several excavations turned up evidence of old buildings on the site and other debris from before the school was built, but no evidence of any secret chambers or tunnels was found.  There were claims of orgies at car washes and airports, and of children being flushed down toilets to secret rooms where they would be abused, then cleaned up and presented back to their parents. Some child interviewees talked of a game called \"naked movie star\" and suggested they were forcibly photographed nude. During trial testimony, some children stated that the \"naked movie star\" game was actually a rhyming taunt used to tease other children\u2014\"What you say is what you are, you're a naked movie star\"\u2014and had nothing to do with having naked pictures taken.\nJudy Johnson, who made the initial allegations, made bizarre and impossible statements about Raymond Buckey, including that he could fly. Though the prosecution asserted Johnson's mental illness was caused by the events of the trial, Johnson had admitted to them that she was mentally ill beforehand. Evidence of Johnson's mental illness was withheld from the defense for three years and, when provided, was in the form of sanitized reports that excluded Johnson's statements, at the order of the prosecution. One of the original prosecutors, Glenn Stevens, left the case in protest and stated that other prosecutors had withheld evidence from the defense, including the information that Johnson's son did not actually identify Ray Buckey in a series of photographs. Stevens also accused Robert Philibosian, the deputy district attorney on the case, of lying and withholding evidence from the court and defense lawyers in order to keep the Buckeys in jail and prevent access to exonerating evidence.\n\nTrials\nTwo trials were conducted for the McMartin preschool case. The first lasted from July 13, 1987, to January 18, 1990, while the second lasted from May 7, 1990, to July 27, 1990.\n\nArrests and preliminary hearing\nOn March 22, 1984, Virginia McMartin, her daughter Peggy McMartin Buckey, her grandchildren Ray and Peggy Ann Buckey, and teachers Mary Ann Jackson, Betty Raidor, and Babette Spitler were charged with 115 counts of child abuse, later expanded to 321 counts of child abuse involving 48 children.\nIn the 20 months of preliminary hearings, the prosecution, led by attorney Lael Rubin, presented their theory of sexual abuse. The children's testimony during the preliminary hearings was inconsistent. Michelle Smith and Lawrence Pazder, co-authors of the now-discredited Satanic ritual abuse autobiography Michelle Remembers, met with the parents and children involved in the case, and were believed by the initial prosecutor Glenn Stevens to have influenced the children's testimony.\nIn 1986, a new district attorney, Ira Reiner, called the evidence \"incredibly weak\" and dropped all charges against Virginia McMartin, Peggy Ann Buckey, Mary Ann Jackson, Betty Raidor and Babette Spitler. Peggy McMartin Buckey and Ray Buckey remained in custody awaiting trial; Peggy McMartin's bail had been set at $1 million and Ray Buckey had been denied bail.\n\nFirst trial\nThe first trial opened on July 13, 1987. During the trial, the prosecution presented seven medical witnesses.  The defense attempted to rebut them with several witnesses, but the judge limited them to one in order to save time.  In their summation, the prosecution argued that they had seven experts on this issue, when the defense only had one.\nIn 1989, Peggy Anne Buckey's appeal to have her teaching credentials re-instated after their suspension was granted. The judge ruled that there was no credible evidence or corroboration to lead to the license being suspended, and that a review of the videotaped interviews with McMartin children \"reveal[ed] a pronounced absence of any evidence implicating [Peggy Ann] in any wrongdoing and ... raises additional doubts of credibility with respect to the children interviewed or with respect to the value of CII interviewing techniques themselves.\" The following day the state credentialing board in Sacramento endorsed the ruling and restored Buckey's right to teach.\n\nPerjury by confession witness\nIn October 1987, jailhouse informant George Freeman was called as a witness and testified that Ray Buckey had confessed to him while sharing a cell. Freeman later attempted to flee the country and confessed to perjury in a series of other criminal cases in which he manufactured testimony in exchange for favorable treatment by the prosecution, in several instances fabricating jailhouse confessions of other inmates. In order to guarantee his testimony during the McMartin case, Freeman was given immunity to previous charges of perjury.\n\nAcquittals\nOn January 18, 1990, after three years of testimony and nine weeks of deliberation by the jury, Peggy McMartin Buckey was acquitted on all counts. Ray Buckey was cleared on 52 of 65 counts, and freed on bail after more than five years in jail. Nine of 11 jurors at a press conference following the trial stated that they believed the children had been molested but the evidence did not allow them to state who had committed the abuse beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven out of the thirteen jurors who remained by the end of the trial voted to acquit Buckey of the charges; the refusal of the remaining two to vote for a not guilty verdict resulted in the deadlock.\n\nSecond trial and dismissal\nRay Buckey was retried later on 6 of the 13 counts of which he was not acquitted in the first trial. The second trial opened on May 7, 1990, and resulted in another hung jury on July 27, 1990. The prosecution then gave up trying to obtain a conviction, and the case was closed with all charges against Ray Buckey dismissed. He had been jailed for five years without ever being convicted of committing any crime.\n\nMedia coverage\nIn 1988, The New York Times reported that the case \"attracted national attention when the authorities speculated that hundreds of children might have been molested and subjected to satanic rituals\" and \"has teetered on the brink of mistrial\".\nThe media coverage was generally skewed towards an uncritical acceptance of the prosecution's viewpoint. David Shaw of the Los Angeles Times wrote a series of articles, which later won the Pulitzer Prize, discussing the flawed and skewed coverage presented by his own paper on the trial. It was only after the case that coverage of the flaws in the evidence and events presented by witnesses and the prosecution were discussed.\nWayne Satz, at the time a reporter for the Los Angeles ABC affiliate television station KABC, reported on the case and the children's allegations. He presented an unchallenged view of the children's and parents' claims. Satz later entered into a romantic relationship with Kee MacFarlane, the social worker at the Children's Institute International, who was interviewing the children. Another instance of media conflict of interest occurred when David Rosenzweig, the editor at the Los Angeles Times overseeing the coverage, became engaged to marry Lael Rubin, the prosecutor.\n\nLegacy\nThe case lasted seven years and cost $15 million, the longest and most expensive criminal case in the history of the United States legal system, and ultimately resulted in no convictions. The McMartin preschool was closed and the building was dismantled. In 2005, one of the children (as an adult) retracted the allegations of abuse.\n\nNever did anyone do anything to me, and I never saw them doing anything. I said a lot of things that didn't happen. I lied. ... Anytime I would give them an answer that they didn't like, they would ask again and encourage me to give them the answer they were looking for. ... I felt uncomfortable and a little ashamed that I was being dishonest. But at the same time, being the type of person I was, whatever my parents wanted me to do, I would do.\nIn The Devil in The Nursery, Margaret Talbot for The New York Times summarized the case:\n\n When you once believed something that now strikes you as absurd, even unhinged, it can be almost impossible to summon that feeling of credulity again. Maybe that is why it is easier for most of us to forget, rather than to try and explain, the Satanic-abuse scare that gripped this country in the early 80's \u2013 the myth that Devil-worshipers had set up shop in our day-care centers, where their clever adepts were raping and sodomizing children, practicing ritual sacrifice, shedding their clothes, drinking blood and eating feces, all unnoticed by parents, neighbors and the authorities. \nMary A. Fischer in an article in Los Angeles magazine said the case was \"simply invented\", and transmogrified into a national cause celebre by the misplaced zeal of six people: Judy Johnson, a seriously mentally ill mother who died of alcoholism; Jane Hoag, the detective who investigated the complaints; Kee MacFarlane, the social worker who interviewed the children; Robert Philibosian, the district attorney who was in a losing battle for re-election; Wayne Satz, the television reporter who first reported the case; and Lael Rubin, the prosecutor.\nIn 1990 Peggy, Ray, and Peggy Ann Buckey spoke to the National Association of State Vocal Organizations about their experiences.  Peggy Ann and Ray Buckey attended the 1997 \"Day of Contrition\" conference in Salem, Massachusetts.  They were joined by other victims and experts of the day-care sex-abuse hysteria.\n\nLegal\nIn many states, laws were passed allowing children to testify on closed-circuit TV so the children would not be traumatized by facing the accused. The arrangement was supported in Maryland v. Craig, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that closed circuit testimony was permissible where it was limited to circumstances with a likelihood that a minor may be harmed by testifying in open court. The case also influenced how very young children were questioned for evidence in court cases with concerns over their capacity for suggestibility and false memories. The case and others like it also affected the investigation of allegations by young children. Normal police procedure is to record using video, tape or notes in interviews with alleged victims. The initial interviews with children by the CII were recorded, and demonstrated to the jury members in the trial the coercive and suggestive techniques used by CII staff to produce allegations.\nThese interviews were instrumental in the jury members failing to produce a guilty verdict against Buckey, and several similar trials with similar interviewing techniques produced similar not guilty verdicts when juries were allowed to view the recordings. In response, prosecutors and investigators began \"abandoning their tape recorders and notepads\" and a manual was produced for investigating child abuse cases that urged prosecutors and investigators not to record their interviews.\n\nContinued allegations of secret tunnels\nIn 1990, parents who believed their children had been abused at the preschool hired archaeologist E. Gary Stickel to investigate the site. In May 1990, Stickel claimed he found evidence of tunnels, consistent with the children's accounts, under the McMartin Preschool using ground-penetrating radar.\nOthers have disagreed with Stickel's conclusions. John Earl wrote in 1995 that the concrete slab floor was undisturbed except for a small patch where the sewer line was tapped into. Once the slab was removed, there was no sign of any materials to line or hold up any tunnels, and the concrete floor would have made it impossible for the defendants to fill in any tunnels once the abuse investigation began. The article concluded that disturbed soil under the slab was from the sewer line and construction fill buried under the slab before it was poured. Further, Earl noted that some fill from beneath the concrete slab was dated to the year 1940.\nW. Joseph Wyatt's 2002 report concluded that the so-called tunnels under the preschool were more plausibly explained as a series of adjacent rubbish pits used by the owners of the site before the preschool's construction in 1966. Materials found during the excavation included bottles predominantly dated to the 1930s and '40s, as well as tin-can fragments, plywood, inner tubes, professionally-butchered livestock bones, four small containers of trash, and a former owner's old mail box.\nOnly three small items found near the edge of the concrete slab were dated after 1966. Wyatt suggested one of these \u2013 a fragment of a plastic snack bag \u2013 was most likely dragged into the pit by rats or other scavengers, just as Stickel himself had suggested likely happened for other debris that did not fit his tunnel theory. The remaining items, per Wyatt, had likely been left by a plumber digging from adjacent to the building to avoid damaging the concrete pad. Moreover, Wyatt speculated that Stickel's conclusions were colored by his collaboration with the parents of the McMartin children.\n\nEffects on child abuse research\nShortly after investigation into the McMartin charges began, the funds to research child sexual abuse greatly increased, notably through the budget allocated for the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN). The agency's budget increased from $1.8 million to $7.2 million between 1983 and 1984, increasing to $15 million in 1985, making it the greatest source of funding for child abuse and neglect prevention in the United States. The majority of this budget went toward studies on sexual abuse with only $5 million going towards physical abuse and neglect.\nFederal funding was also used to arrange conferences on ritual abuse, providing an aura of respectability as well as allowing prosecutors to exchange tips on the best means of obtaining convictions. A portion of the funds were used to publish the book Behind the Playground Walls, which used a sample of children drawn from the McMartin families. The book claimed to study the effects of \"reported\" rather than actual abuse but portrayed all of the McMartin children as actual victims of abuse despite a lack of convictions during the trials and without mentioning questions about the reality of the accusations. Another grant of $173,000 went to David Finkelhor who used the funds to investigate allegations of day care sexual abuse throughout the country, combining the study of verified crimes by admitted pedophiles and unverified accusations of satanic ritual abuse.\n\nMedia\nIn 1995, HBO produced Indictment: The McMartin Trial, a movie based on the trials.\nIn 2019, Oxygen produced Uncovered: The McMartin Family Trials, a documentary about the events.\n\nSee also\nFootnotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nButler, EW; Fukurai H; Dimitrius J; Krooth R (2001).

In 1993, the second singer (and first secular artist) to record the song was Country singer Kathy Mattea on her album Good News, which won the Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album. Lowry would record the song several times himself, most notably with the Gaither Vocal Band on their 1998 Christmas album, Still the Greatest Story Ever Told.\nThe song has since gone on to become a modern Christmas classic, recorded by hundreds of artists over the years, across multiple genres. Several recordings have reached the top ten in various Billboard charts. The song encourages contemplation of the relationship between Mary and her son, although some religious commentators have criticized the lyrics.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\"Mary, Did You Know?\" was originally released in the key of E\u266d minor, with a tempo of 53 beats per minute in 44 meter, based around a chord progression of E\u266dm\u2013D\u266d\u2013A\u266dm7\u2013B\u266d7sus4\u2013B\u266d7. The lyrics evolved from a series of questions that Lowry scripted for a Christmas program at his church:\n\nI just tried to put into words the unfathomable. I started thinking of the questions I would have for her if I were to sit down & have coffee with Mary. You know, \"What was it like raising God?\" \"What did you know?\" \"What didn't you know?\"\nNone of the questions are answered in the song. Instead, the lyrics poetically invite the listener to contemplate the relationship between Mary and her newborn divine son, even if her faith and awareness did not yet include the details of what would unfold.\nThe text has received both praise for reflecting the love of God, as well as criticism for perceived ambiguity or lack of theological depth. Baptist theologian Michael Frost suggested that it was the \"most sexist Christmas song ever written... It treats her like a clueless child... Could you imagine a song asking Abraham 17 times if he knew he'd be the father of a great nation?\" Robert McTeigue and Michelle Arnold, both Roman Catholic commentators, have questioned a particular line of text (\"This Child that you delivered will soon deliver you\") that might confuse or challenge the belief that Mary herself was conceived without sin. On the other hand the Roman Catholic author Karl Erickson implored people to praise Mary, Did You Know? as a \"beautiful expression of God\u2019s love for all of us\" and responded to criticism of the piece, stating that \"Mary, Did You Know is a song and not a theological essay. Even as simple Christmas music, however, it does a fine job conveying the beauty and profound mystery of the Incarnation. Yes, there is some poetic license taken within the lyrics, but much less than is taken within innumerable other songs we are asked to sing regularly\u2014Sing a New Church, for example.\" Lutheran clergyman Timothy Koch states that criticism of the song is unwarranted because Mary, Did You Know? is simply poetry using rhetorical questions and that it is \"actually communicating to the singer and hearer the truths about Jesus\", including doctrines of salvation, homoousious, and the theotokos.\nIn 2017, Toronto-based theologian Jennifer Henry wrote new lyrics that address the criticisms and echo Mary's words from the biblical Magnificat. These new lyrics have begun to spread in religious settings.\n\nStage musical\nThe song was used as the basis for a stage musical, written by David Guthrie and Bruce Greer and also titled Mary, Did You Know?, which won the 1999 Gospel Music Association Dove Award for Musical of the Year.\n\nCharted cover recordings\nKenny Rogers and Wynonna Judd (1996)\nA duet, recorded by Wynonna Judd and Kenny Rogers on Rogers' holiday album The Gift, peaked at No. 55 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1997.\nChart positions\n\nClay Aiken (2004)\n\"Mary, Did You Know?\" is the fifth single from Clay Aiken's 2004 Christmas album Merry Christmas with Love. Aiken performed the song on The Tyra Banks Show.\nChart positions\n\nCeeLo Green (2012)\n\"Mary, Did You Know?\" is the eleventh track on CeeLo Green's Christmas album Cee Lo's Magic Moment. On December 15, 2012, the song appeared on the US R&B Songs chart at No. 22 and peaked three weeks later at No. 9. This version is the slowest of all. A remixed version also served as the closing credits song to the 2014 20th Century Fox movie Son of God.\nChart positions\n\nPentatonix (2014)\n\"Mary, Did You Know?\" is the sixth track on Pentatonix's second Christmas album, That's Christmas to Me. The song both debuted and peaked at No. 26 on the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week ending December 6, 2014.\nChart positions\n\nJordan Smith (2015)\nIn 2015, Jordan Smith performed the song on the season nine finals of The Voice (U.S.). This version debuted and peaked at No. 24 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart and at No. 2 on its Holiday 100 chart in the week ending January 2, 2016.\n\nZara Larsson (2017)\nIn 2017, Zara Larsson's cover of the song was included in the soundtrack to the film The Star, released on October 27, 2017. The cover went on to peak at number 55 on the Swedish charts during the 2018 holiday period, making another appearance for one week in 2019 at number 87.\n\nCarrie Underwood (2020)\nIn 2020, Carrie Underwood included the song as the eighth track on her debut Christmas album, My Gift. Underwood's version charted on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs, peaking at No. 31. Underwood performed the song on The Kelly Clarkson Show.\n\nDolly Parton (2020)\nIn 2020, Dolly Parton covered the song on her album A Holly Dolly Christmas. It was released as the first single from the album on August 21, 2020. Parton performed the song for the first time during a livestream event on Amazon Music on November 13, 2020. She also performed the song during NBC's annual Christmas in Rockefeller Center tree-lighting ceremony on December 2 and again during her CBS special A Holly Dolly Christmas on December 6. Parton's version of the song peaked at number 49 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart and number 18 on the Billboard Christian Digital Song Sales chart.\nChart positions\n\nMaverick City Music (2022)\n\nMaverick City Music's version of \"Mary Did You Know?\" impacted Christian radio in the United States on November 25, 2022, becoming the first single from the album.

The most common method is hot-dip galvanizing, in which the parts are coated by submerging them in a bath of hot, molten zinc.\n\nProtective action\nThe zinc coating, when intact, prevents corrosive substances from reaching the underlying iron.  Additional electroplating such as a chromate conversion coating may be applied to provide further surface passivation to the substrate material.\n\nHistory and etymology\nThe process is named after the Italian physician, physicist, biologist and philosopher  Luigi Galvani (9 September 1737 \u2013 4 December 1798). The earliest known example of galvanized iron was discovered on 17th-century Indian armour in the Royal Armouries Museum collection in the United Kingdom. \nThe term \"galvanized\" can also be used metaphorically of any stimulus which results in activity by a person or group of people. \nIn modern usage, the term \"galvanizing\" has largely come to be associated with zinc coatings, to the exclusion of other metals. Galvanic paint, a precursor to hot-dip galvanizing, was patented by Stanislas Sorel, of Paris, on June 10, 1837, as an adoption of a term from a highly fashionable field of contemporary science, despite having no evident relation to it.\n\nMethods\nHot-dip galvanizing deposits a thick, robust layer of zinc iron alloys on the surface of a steel item. In the case of automobile bodies, where additional decorative coatings of paint will be applied, a thinner form of galvanizing is applied by electrogalvanizing. The hot-dip process generally does not reduce strength to a measurable degree, with the exception of high-strength steels where hydrogen embrittlement can become a problem. \nThermal diffusion galvanizing, or Sherardizing, provides a zinc diffusion coating on iron- or copper-based materials.\n\nEventual corrosion\nGalvanized steel can last for many decades if other supplementary measures are maintained, such as paint coatings and additional sacrificial anodes. Corrosion in non-salty environments is caused mainly by levels of sulfur dioxide in the air.\n\nGalvanized construction steel\nThis is the most common use for galvanized metal; hundreds of thousands of tons of steel products are galvanized annually worldwide. In developed countries, most larger cities have several galvanizing factories, and many items of steel manufacture are galvanized for protection. Typically these include street furniture, building frameworks, balconies, verandahs, staircases, ladders, walkways, and more. Hot dip galvanized steel is also used for making steel frames as a basic construction material for steel frame buildings.\n\nGalvanized piping\nIn the early 20th century, galvanized piping swiftly took the place of previously-used cast iron and lead in cold-water plumbing. Practically, galvanized piping rusts from the inside out, building up layers of plaque on the inside of the piping, causing both water pressure problems and eventual pipe failure. These plaques can flake off, leading to visible impurities in water and a slight metallic taste. The life expectancy of galvanized piping is about 40\u201350 years, but it may vary on how well the pipes were built and installed. Pipe longevity also depends on the thickness of zinc in the original galvanizing, which ranges on a scale from G01 to G360.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nI.Yu. Pchelintseva; A.N.

According to the International Residential Code, a tiny house\u2019s floorspace is no larger than 400 square feet (37 m2). Proponents suggest that tiny homes could offer low-cost, eco-friendly alternatives within the housing market and serve as a transitional housing option for homeless individuals.\n\nIn the United States\nShotgun shacks were small, single-story buildings in use among urban Americans from the late 19th century through the Great Depression. Although few such houses contained more than two bedrooms, they provided accommodation for the blue-collar families in Southern U.S. cities like New Orleans.\nThe average size of newly constructed homes in the United States grew from 1,780 sq ft (165 m2) in 1978 to 2,479 sq ft (230.3 m2) in 2007, and further still to 2,662 sq ft (247.3 m2) in 2013.\nHenry David Thoreau and the publication of his book Walden are often quoted as an early inspiration for the tiny-house movement. The modern movement is considered to have started in the 1970s, with artists such as Allan Wexler investigating the idea of contemporary compact living. Early pioneers include Lloyd Kahn, author of Shelter (1973), and Lester R. Walker, author of Tiny Houses (1987). Sarah Susanka started the \"counter-movement\" for smaller houses, something she details in her book The Not So Big House (1997).\n\nJay Shafer, another pioneer of the tiny-house movement, began working on his first tiny house \u2014 measuring 110 sq ft (10 m2) \u2014 in Iowa in 1997; it was completed in 1999. Tiny houses on wheels were then popularized by Shafer, who designed and resided in a 96 sq ft (8.9 m2) house for two months before founding the Tumbleweed Tiny House Company. (He left that company in 2012 to later found the Four Lights Tiny House Company. Shafer had to close down the latter after Tumbleweed came after him with lawsuits.) In 2002, Shafer co-founded the Small House Society along with Greg Johnson, Shay Salomon, and Nigel Valdez.  Salomon and Valdez subsequently published their guide to the modern tiny-house movement, Little House on a Small Planet, in 2006, and Johnson published his memoir, Put Your Life on a Diet, in 2008.\nWith the Great Recession affecting the economy of the United States from 2007 to 2009, the tiny-house movement gained more traction due to its perceived affordability and environmentalist nature. Despite this, tiny-house purchases represented a minimal percentage of real estate transactions, with only approximately 1% of total home buyers at the time acquiring houses qualified to be labeled as tiny homes. \nSmall houses are also used as accessory dwelling units (ADUs) to serve as additional on-property housing for aging relatives or returning children, as a home office, or as a guest house. Tiny houses typically cost about $20,000 to $50,000 as of 2012.\nIn 2013, the Tiny House Fair at Yestermorrow, Vermont, was organized by Elaine Walker. At the event, Shafer suggested promoting ethical business practices and offering guidelines for the construction of tiny houses on wheels. Walker continued this effort in 2015, creating the non-profit organization American Tiny House Association.\nTiny houses have received considerable media coverage, with a television show on the movement, Tiny House Nation, airing in 2014, alongside the similar program Tiny House Hunters.\n\nOutside the United States\nWhile the movement is most active in the United States, interest in tiny homes has been observed in other countries as well:\n\nIn Australia, designers such as Fred Schultz have created attention for the tiny-house movement. Owned by Grant Emans, Designer Eco Tiny Homes is Australia's largest tiny-home builder, creating roughly 100 tiny-homes annually out of 2 factories in Ulladulla. In 2022, Designer Eco Tiny Homes opened the world's first tiny-home showroom with a 9.6 m (31 ft) long home. In 2024, Konpak Tiny Homes launched Australia's first approvable tiny home to the Australian public. Currently, many tiny home manufactures design and build to meet the caravan regulations in efforts to avoid needing Council/Building approval. Although in practice, many of the buildings are not getting weighed by the manufacturer and are indeed being sold over the 4.5 tonne weight limitation.\nIn Canada, the legality of tiny homes depends on the location of the home and whether it is mobile or stationary. In Toronto, a tiny home requires a building permit and a connection to the power grid. In December 2019, Edmonton introduced by-laws permitting the construction of tiny homes on foundations, removing the former 5.5 m (18 ft) minimum width requirement. Some municipalities consider buildings which are not connected to the city electricity grid and sewerage systems in violation of building codes, possibly to avoid incidents similar to the leaky condo crisis in British Columbia, which resulted in an overhaul of the province's building codes. Similarly, some mobile tiny homes have been rejected from spaces designed for recreational vehicles (RVs) due to the tiny home failing to meet RV criteria. An \"eco-village\" of homes under 600 sq ft (56 m2) in Okotoks known as the Homestead Project was proposed in 2017 but faced opposition from the Okotoks residents. Eventually, in August 2019, the council voted not to consider the project further after deciding to honor a petition with 3,000 signatures opposed to the development.\nIn France, the Ty Village opened its doors 6 km (3.7 mi) away from University of Rennes Saint-Brieuc campus in Brittany, in September 2019.\nIn Germany, the community of Vauban created 5,000 households on an old military base in Freiburg im Breisgau. The planned density of the building in that area was 50 dwelling units per acre. British architect Richard Horden, at the Technical University of Munich, developed the Micro Compact Home (M-CH), a high-end small (76 sq ft or 7.1 m2) cube designed for 1\u20132 persons, with functional spaces for cooking, hygiene, dining/working, and sleeping.\nIn New Zealand, company-built units are called mobile homes and tiny houses on wheels. As of 2021, it tends to be a grassroots initiative. Bryce Langston \u2013 a filmmaker with a passion for small space design, permaculture, and downsized, eco-friendly living \u2013 has created short, documentary-style videos on small space living for YouTube via his channel and website Living Big in a Tiny House.\nIn Spain, Eva Prats and Ricardo Flores presented the 300 sq ft (28 m2) House in a Suitcase.\nIn Sweden, a chef couple launched a forest-to-table movement, Stedsans in the Woods, out of tiny home cabins for rent in a Swedish forest. They have shared the blueprints for their A-frame cabins.\nIn the United Kingdom, Tiny Eco Homes UK has developed several customizable tiny house models starting at \u00a326,000. Dozens of the homes are being used as primary residences across the UK and mainland Europe. Abito created intelligent living spaces apartments of 353 sq ft (32.8 m2) in Manchester. Tiny House Scotland has created the \"Nesthouse,\" a 23 m2 (250 sq ft) modular movable small eco-house to explore the possibilities of sustainable small-scale living in a highly insulated timber-framed structure with some passive house principles ensuring very low energy usage, with an estimated cost of \u20ac55,000. Northern Ireland has also seen a small but growing community of tiny house owners, although the planning rules do not specifically accommodate tiny houses, with the result being that the planning process for a tiny house would need to be decided upon on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn Brazil, Tiny Houses Brazil was the first mini-house factory in the country, operating out of a shed on a farm property in Porangaba, S\u00e3o Paulo. The company develops projects and builds mini-houses on wheels. The houses are customized and built by hand with values of R$90,000.\nIn South Africa, the company Freedom Tiny Homes builds and sells tiny houses. The Tiny House Project is a non-profit working to promote tiny house living in Africa. They offer workshops and educational resources to encourage people to build their own tiny homes.\n\nIssues\nOne of the biggest obstacles faced by the tiny-house movement is the difficulty of finding a region in which such a house can be constructed. Zoning regulations typically specify minimum square footage for new constructions on a foundation, and for tiny houses on wheels, parking on one's own land may be prohibited by local regulations against camping. While tiny houses have the potential to reduce building and living costs, they can still be costly as a result of the cost of the land they occupy.\nIn addition, RV parks do not always allow tiny houses unless they meet the criteria required for RVs. Tiny houses on wheels are considered RVs and are not suitable for permanent residence, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association. From RV Business, \"The RVIA will continue to shy away from allowing members who produce products that are referred to as 'tiny houses' or 'tiny homes.' (However, the RVIA does allow 'tiny home' builders to join as long as their units are built to RV or park-model RV standards.)\" \nSome lower court decisions in the U.S. have struck down zoning laws related to size, which pose an obstacle to tiny housing. One such case was League of South Jersey, Inc v. Township of Berlin, in which the court found that a zoning law related to the size of a home did not advance its stated goal of protecting citizens, causing the law to be repealed. This, and other similar decisions, have assisted in allowing for the propagation of the tiny-house movement despite their infrequency.\nIn 2014, the first \"tiny-house friendly town\" was declared in Spur, Texas; it was later clarified that a tiny house may not be on wheels, but rather must be secured to a foundation.\nIn July 2016, Washington County, Utah revised their zoning regulations to accommodate some types of tiny housing.\nIncreasingly, tiny houses have become larger, heavier, and more expensive. This has signaled a move away from the initial movement goal of a reduced environmental impact as the popularity of tiny homes has taken off.\nTiny houses have been labeled as impractical spaces to raise families in. Overcrowding and lack of space have been noted to be detrimental to both physical and mental health, with the potential to affect academic performance in youth negatively\nIn New Zealand, some district councils have sought to classify mobile homes and tiny homes on wheels as buildings, subject to the Building Act 2004. This was backed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) in a determination that was then challenged in District Court (Dall v MBIE). Judge Callaghan found in favor of Dall's argument that his home was not a building, ruling the council and MBIE to have erred in saying it was. Other cases have since been heard, but no further clarifications have been made by the New Zealand Government as of January 2021.\n\nHousing for the homeless\nThe Great Recession fueled the growth of the tiny-house movement. In several cities, an entrenched homeless population formed around tent cities, encampments that evolved to become semi-permanent housing. Homelessness in these communities was driven by foreclosures and expensive mortgages as a result of the United States housing bubble.\nTiny houses became an affordable option for individuals who lost their homes as a result of financial hardship. With their low cost and relatively easy construction, tiny houses have been adopted as shelters for the homeless in Eugene, Oregon; Olympia, Washington; Ithaca, New York; and other cities. Communities of tiny houses offer residents a transition towards self-sufficiency. Communities such as Othello Village in Seattle, Washington, originally lacked electricity and heat. In Seattle, non-profits have stepped in to help provide amenities.\nProviding housing to the homeless reduces costs for municipalities. The long-term viability of tiny houses for homeless people is entirely dependent on the structure and sustainability of the model. Benefits of access to housing include privacy, storage, safety, restoration of dignity and stability. For cities such as Chicago, tiny houses are seen as an appealing option to close the gap in housing availability.\nIn Reno, Nevada, faith-based groups and community advocates have legislated new zoning for housing of homeless people in a tiny home community called Camp Safe. The community, which opened in October 2023, has 50 8'x8' tiny house units, which the city calls ModPods. Each ModPod cost a $13,000 to build, compared with the $3,800 the county had initially estimated. The program has come out to $5.25 million. In 2020, Worcester, Massachusetts, announced plans for a village of 21 tiny homes for the chronically homeless.  Due to complication from the COVID-19 pandemic, the city had to pivot to micro-units within a building rather than individual tiny homes. The city unveiled 24 long-term supportive housing units in October 2023, with the goal of opening to tenants in December.\nOne challenge besides zoning and funding has been a NIMBY response by communities, which may weigh concerns over collections of tiny homes devolving into shantytowns or blighted neighborhoods which reduce the property values of the surrounding neighborhoods.  Community planners have also voiced concerns in regards to the possibility of tiny house communities developing into shantytowns.\nIn California, the city of Richmond has engaged University of California, Berkeley students in the THIMBY (Tiny House In My Backyard) project with a pilot program aimed at developing a model of six transitional tiny homes to be placed in the city. THIMBY, with the support of Sustainable Housing at California, intends to foster an environment that allows homeowners and transitional housing residents to live as neighbors rather than in a landlord-tenant relationship. THIMBY acquires target locations for tiny housing development through surveying interested homeowners offering to rent out backyard space for the tiny housing unit. While Sustainable Housing at California has independently scouted out interested individuals for the initial pilot project, the organization also aims to work closely with the City of Richmond's Tiny House on Wheels ordinance to bolster city-level efforts to provide affordable housing and shelter. This is in line with developing efforts in the San Francisco Bay Area to use micro-apartments and tiny houses in combating the housing crisis and homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area. Similar efforts of using tiny houses to house the homeless are also ongoing in Oakland through a partnership between the City of Oakland and Laney College. In 2021, the California based nonprofit organization Hope of the Valley funded and built 4 tiny home villages in Los Angeles, forming the first formal, legally uncontested tiny home project in the region. More informal efforts to build tiny homes for homeless communities had been made in the past by citizens in Los Angeles, but were ultimately seized by the city due to concerns over sanitation.\nAs of 2022, tiny homes have been gaining popularity as a temporary solution for homelessness across the West coast, and in the Bay Area. Homeless individuals or families are commonly allowed to live in tiny homes for six months while seeking permanent housing, often with help from caseworkers; if they cannot, they are evicted and then the tiny home is given to the next person or family on the waiting list. An analysis of data from several tiny home communities in Santa Clara and Alameda counties found that compared to dormitory-style homeless shelters, which led to permanent housing less than 15% of the time, tiny home communities led to permanent housing almost 50% of the time. Dormitory-style homeless shelters cost about $17,000 per bed per year; some tiny home communities like Oakland's Oak Street cost $22,500 per bed per year (with onsite portable toilets), with the inclusion of ensuite bathrooms as seen in certain San Jose shelters resulting in a cost increase to approximately $34,000 per bed per year. While the median studio apartment in San Jose rents for $29,000 per year as of 2022, tiny houses come equipped with support services to help homeless persons get jobs and permanent housing, resulting in higher overall costs.\nIn Edinburgh, Scotland, the Social Enterprise Social Bite asked Jonathan Avery of Tiny House Scotland to design a two bedroom variation of his \"NestHouse\" tiny house for its Homeless Tiny House Village in the Granton area of Edinburgh. The village was opened on May 17, 2018, by Angela Constance, the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities, and features eleven \"NestHouse\" Duo tiny houses and a community hub building all built by Carbon Dynamic.\n\nPros and cons\nIn the co-authored research article The Psychology of Home Environments, it's argued that the drive behind the tiny house movement is centered around desires of modesty and conservation, in addition to environmental consciousness, self-sufficiency, and wanting a life of adventure. In building tiny houses, there is often a misalignment between the needs of the occupant(s), and the expressed design from the creating team. This reality is used as a call for architects and design teams to work with psychologists to build tiny homes that are better suited towards the needs of the occupant(s). In understanding these considerations, it is important to note that not everyone is suited for a tiny house.\nSmaller homes are less expensive than larger ones in terms of taxes and building, heating, maintenance, and repair costs. The lower cost of living may be advantageous to those with little savings, such as people aged 55 and older. In addition to costing less, small houses may encourage a less cluttered, simpler lifestyle, and reduce ecological impacts for their residents.  The typical size of a small home seldom exceeds 500 square feet (46 m2). The typical tiny house on wheels is usually less than 8 by 20 ft (2.4 by 6.1 m), with livable space totaling 120 sq ft (11 m2) or less, for ease of towing and to exempt it from the need for a building permit.\nSmall houses may emphasize design over size, utilize dual purpose features and multi-functional furniture, and incorporate technological advances of space saving equipment and appliances. Vertical space optimization is also a common feature of small houses and apartments. An example of this is the use of loft spaces for sleeping and storage. Because of overall height restrictions related to the ability to easily tow a tiny house, it is common for lofts to be between 3.3 ft and 5.5 ft (1.0m and 1.7m) inside height. Therefore, for accessibility of elderly and disabled people, larger floor plans that keep essential elements like bed, bathroom and kitchen on the main floor are more typical.\nThe increased utilization of small houses as second homes or retirement houses may lead to development of more land. People interested in building a small home can encounter institutional \"discrimination\" when building codes require minimum size well above the size of a small home. Also, neighbors may be hostile because they fear negative impacts on their property values and have concerns about increased taxes.\nMore broadly, these sentiments of \"othering\" homeless and unhoused persons have culminated into a broader movement of NIMBY-ism, or \"Not in My Backyard.\"\nThe advent of NIMBY-ism occupied much of community organizing and housing advocacy dialogue in the 1980s, so much that some coined it \"the populist political philosophy of the 1980s.\" In many ways, NIMBY philosophy functions through the \"spatialization of stigma,\" allowing residents and homeowners to reallocate and redefine neighborhoods and local communities and, consequently, which individuals should be allowed to occupy such an area. While modern U.S. society has statistically experienced a growing need for human services and welfare, researchers have acknowledged that \"The stigmatization of persons and places are thus mutually constitutive of community rejection and organized resistance to human service facility sitting.\" In effect, community resistance to housing advocacy and affordability measures further exacerbates the dwindling number of public resources and social services available to vulnerable and displaced homeless persons.\nConcerns over the efficacy of tiny homes for homeless people persist. Some critics have argued that, similar to other forms of anti-homelessness legislation, tiny home villages are fundamentally carceral, designed to push its tenants into less public spaces near city outskirts in an effort to marginalize homeless people, rather than provide long-term stability.\nBy treating homelessness as a non-familiarized issue, residents and homeowners are effectively exempt from community obligations towards the well-being and sheltering of other community members experiencing homelessness. Despite the framing of housing as a fundamental rights-based issue, community perspectives have evolved towards a more economic, individualized form that correlates a person's home-ownership and housing to their values and ethics, employ-ability, and general ability to provide for themselves and their families. As such, the inability of both private and public sectors to supplement the widening gap of affordable housing options and shelter is, in some ways, conveniently explained by an individual's supposed inability to ensure living stability, maintain financial independence, and solidify their position within the society at large.\n\nElectrical setup and grid impacts\nTiny homes threaten increased grid defection because of their inherently low energy demands as a result of their small size. Their customized builds and smaller energy demand often results in the ability to sustain a tiny house entirely on rooftop photovoltaics such as roof-mounted solar panels. This has become especially prominent due to the continuously decreasing price of solar panels and batteries, and tiny homes have become notable as an example of an existing and commercially available alternative off-grid option for housing.\n\nOff-grid solar electrical system\nEach space and house will have their own energy consumption profile and generation demand. Consequently, they must size their power equipment accordingly. The needed size of battery systems to store captured energy or grid-supplied energy that will be used during times without power production from the rooftop solar, such as when there is inadequate insolation, depend on the generation capacity (as to not under or oversize the battery bank), the type of batteries used, their individual capacity (A\u22c5h), the discharge rate allowable per cycle (%), the size of loads (W), how long they will be run, and how many days of storage are needed. Battery sizing calculators are available online to simplify this process. Additionally, battery balancers, sensors that can read and recalibrate the available capacity, or state of charge, between different battery cells, can be added to extend the life of a battery system to prohibit voltage offset or non-ideal current flow, potentially damaging or capacity reducing to batteries over time. Batteries are rated in terms of ampere-hours with their discharge rate and capacity set by the manufacturer at a specific current and total amount of time, as voltage differs with temperature and power will vary with rate of discharge.\n\nTo fully convert a tiny home for living capacities off-grid, other power electronic power equipment is necessary, such as a charge controller, an inverter to power AC loads or down-regulators for DC loads, and proper protection devices such as circuit breakers and fuses. Specific sine inverters may offer simultaneous grid power hookup, called grid-tie inverters, in case of insufficient energy generation locally. Grid-tie inverters are of academic interest and are being studied by utilities for their impacts and potential benefits to voltage regulation, infrastructure implications, protection schema requirements, economics, and optimum policy regarding integration for implementation into the electrical grid with the rise of distributed generation, namely residential supplied solar power.\n\nSize of homes\nTiny homes typically range between 100 and 300 square feet (9.3 and 27.9 m2). Considering the small size of tiny homes in comparison to that of average-sized homes, energy costs are consistently smaller; moreover, tiny home power grids are typically sourced from solar panels, which decreases the amount of publicly produced energy necessary to sustain the home. More importantly, the price difference of using solar power on a tiny home in comparison to an average-sized home significantly decreases the homeowner's expenses, resulting in a significant difference between the energy emissions and cost necessary for output between a tiny home and average-sized home. While a tiny home is sustained to operate on 914 kilowatt hours a year, producing on average 1,144 pounds (0.519 t) of carbon dioxide, an average-sized house requires 12,733 kilowatt hours, which releases close to 16,000 pounds (7.3 t).\nConsequently, tiny homes inevitably require the consumption of less energy to support the homeowner. As a result, people living in tiny homes typically limit their engagement with materialism. The limited space of a tiny home encourages owners to make sacrifices in regards to the accumulation of materialistic items. It further allows homeowners to re-evaluate their personal habits, which subsequently translates into awareness regarding environmental sourcing. The concept of a \"tiny\" home reflects all aspects of the chosen lifestyle; a minimized space necessitates minimal consumer spending while the limited amount of surface area provided decreases the rate and level of energy consumption.\n\nEnvironmentally conscious design\nHuman beings have been the main contributors in recent environmental changes. One critical proponent of these changes relates to infrastructure; buildings affect both human beings and the environment. However the costs tend to effect the environment while the benefits are exclusive to humans. The intention of building new infrastructure is to guarantee its sustainability for a long period of time. As a result, the less environmentally intentional a facility is, the more it will depend on consumption of natural resources. \"Part of the very definition of a tiny home is that it be constructed with environmentally conscious and renewable materials.\" Most tiny homes are designed to receive their services in ways that are less environmentally exhaustible. Electrical grids and public utilities are a distinguishable way tiny homes receive various water, electric and plumbing services. This detail is critical for consideration when individuals move from average sized homes to tiny homes because it allows individuals to both save money while using less environmental resources. Another important environmentally conscious feature relates to toilets. Some tiny homes are equipped with incinerator toilets which get rid of waste by burning it rather than flushing. By eliminating toilet flushing, the amount of water used in a household significantly decreases. An alternative feature is a compost toilet which works by decomposing the waste using evaporation to remove it. Therefore, not only are tiny homes energy efficient, the makeup of these homes are also intended to be environmentally friendly. Subsequently, in order for new materials to be both utilized in construction and sustainable for long periods of time, the production of such materials are dependent on various chemicals; this added step removes additional resources from the environment. An alternative to this is the usage of recycled materials. The tiny homes designed by a group in Texas consciously avoid using new materials in their construction. Because 30\u201340% of energy consumption is expended by human beings, it has been argued that infrastructure is best fit to include the consumption of humans within its blueprints.\nIndividuals who live in tiny homes are directly connected to the environment primarily because of the close proximity between tiny homes and the surrounding ecosystems. Through constant contact, the homeowner is given the opportunity to better understand the functions of nature. Such an understanding allows for an increase in environmental awareness.\nMore so, the design of tiny homes are subject to individual modification; the style, level of sustainability, intricacy, materials used, and modifications are all determined by homeowner preferences.\n\nEnvironment and homelessness\nHomelessness is a critical issue in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, about 550,000 individuals were experiencing homelessness on a given night in 2018. Over half of those individuals were able to sleep in different types of shelters while roughly thirty-five percent were unable to reside in a sheltered area. Despite the little information provided on this issue in popular media, homelessness has the capacity to affect the environment dramatically. According to the Environmental Council of Sacramento, homelessness is a contributor to environmental deterioration. For example, waste [litter, drug paraphernalia, etc.]  produced by the homeless accumulates around their living spaces which tend to be near waterways, sewage systems, or parks. This leads to the contamination of the surrounding ecosystem. The Environmental Council offers steps towards conserving the environment while simultaneously dealing with the issue of homelessness. These steps include the cleaning of various water systems and public spaces in order to provide both clean water and clean areas for all individuals of the community. One of these steps also includes governmental intervention in establishing sanitary and safe spaces for the homeless in order to prevent further environmental destruction. Luckily, systems for just that are beginning to form though the tiny house movement.\nA critical form of combating chronic homelessness is the establishment of tiny house communities. Those behind such establishments aim to help individuals solve their housing problems and offer a space where individuals can connect with others who find themselves in similar circumstances. Creating these communities requires a variety of support, however the end goal is ultimately shared. The primary actors behind the building and funding of tiny homes for the homeless are non-profit organizations. Their goal is not only to give homeless people a place to live, but also offer them resources to help them in all aspects of their lives. Building communities of tiny homes for the homeless is a group effort involving the homeless, cities themselves, and housing patrons. With them, efforts to combat homelessness and its effects on the environment are being continuously improved.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\n Media related to Small houses at Wikimedia Commons"], "Ground_truth": "A studio apartment or a studio flat is a combination of a living room, bedroom and kitchen in one single room.

The first recorded use of a related phrase is by Frederick the Great of Prussia. It was likely popularized by its use in a poem by Ogden Nash and has since become a common colloquialism.\nBefore the 19th century, breeds of dogs (other than lap dogs) were largely functional. They performed activities such as hunting, tracking, watching, protecting and guarding; and language describing the dog often reflected these roles. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, \"In the oldest proverbs and phrases dogs are rarely depicted as faithful or as man's best friend, but as vicious, ravening, or watchful.\" Beginning in the 18th century, multiplying in the 19th and flourishing in the 20th century, language and attitudes towards dogs began to shift.\n\nArgos and Odysseus\nIn Homer's Odyssey (c. 8th century BC), upon Odysseus' return, his beloved dog Argos is the only individual to recognize him.\n\nAs they [Eumaeus and Ulysses] were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said:\nEumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?\"\n\nThis hound,\" answered Eumaeus, \"belonged to him who has died in a far country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master's hand is no longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.\"\n\nSources\nKing Frederick II of Prussia\nThe statement Dog is man's best friend was first recorded as being made by Frederick II, King of Prussia (1740\u20131786). Frederick referred to one of his Italian Greyhounds as his best friend.\n\nPoet C.S. van Winkle\nThe earliest citation in the U.S. is traced to a poem by C.S. Winkle printed in The New-York Literary Journal, Volume 4, 1821:\n\nThe faithful dog \u2013 why should I strive\nTo speak his merits, while they live\nIn every breast, and man's best friend\nDoes often at his heels attend.\n\nAttorney George Graham Vest\nIn 1870 Warrensburg, Missouri, George Graham Vest represented a farmer suing for damages after his dog, Old Drum, had been shot and killed. During the trial, Vest stated that he would \"win the case or apologize to every dog in Missouri.\" \nVest's closing argument to the jury made no reference to any of the testimony offered during the trial, and instead offered a eulogy of sorts. Vest's \"Eulogy of the Dog\" is one of the most enduring passages of purple prose in American courtroom history (only a partial transcript has survived):\n\nGentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.\nGentlemen of the jury: A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.\n\nIf fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death.\nVest won the case (the jury awarded $50 to the dog's owner) and also won its appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court.\nIn 1958, a statue of Old Drum was erected on the Johnson County Courthouse lawn containing a summation of Vest's closing speech, \"A man's best friend is his dog.\"\nAs well, a bust of the dog resides in the Missouri Supreme Court building in Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\nVoltaire\nMuch earlier, however, Voltaire had written in his Dictionnaire philosophique of 1764:\n\nCHIEN. \u2014 Il semble que la nature ait donn\u00e9 le chien \u00e0 l'homme pour sa d\u00e9fense et pour son plaisir. C'est de tous les animaux le plus fid\u00e8le : c'est le meilleur ami que puisse avoir l'homme.\nTranslated, this reads:\n\nDOG. \u2014 It seems that nature has given the dog to man for his defense and for his pleasure. Of all the animals it is the most faithful: it is the best friend man can possibly have.\n\nOgden Nash\nIn 1941, Ogden Nash wrote \"An Introduction to Dogs,\" beginning:\n\nThe dog is man's best friend.\nHe has a tail on one end.\nUp in front he has teeth.\nAnd four legs underneath.\n\nSee also\nPet humanization\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "The first recorded use of a related phrase to the saying man best friend, is by Frederick the Great of Prussia.

For its first 32 seasons, the championship game pitted the SEC East Division regular season champion against the West Division regular season champion. With the SEC eliminating football divisions after the 2023 season, future games will feature the top two teams in the conference standings. Since 2007, the game has typically been played on the first Saturday of December, and the game has been held in Atlanta since 1994, first at the Georgia Dome, and at Mercedes-Benz Stadium since 2017.\nTen of the fourteen current SEC members have played in the SEC Championship Game, with Kentucky, Ole Miss, Texas A&M, and Vanderbilt being the exceptions. Oklahoma and Texas will play their first SEC seasons in 2024. During the divisional era, the overall series was led 19\u201313 by the West Division.\nWhile ten SEC members have played in the game, only six have won: Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee of the East Division, and Alabama, Auburn, and LSU of the West Division. Each of these teams has won the championship multiple times.\n\nHistory\nThe SEC was the first NCAA conference in any division to hold a football championship game that was exempt from NCAA limits on regular-season contests. Such a game was made possible by two separate developments. The first came in 1987, when the NCAA membership approved a proposal sponsored by the Division II Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference and Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association that allowed any conference with at least 12 football members to split into divisions and stage a championship game between the divisional winners. The SEC took advantage of this rule by adding the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina in 1992, bringing the conference membership to 12, and splitting into two football divisions. The format has since been adopted by other conferences to decide their football champion (the first being the Big 12 in 1996).\nThe first two SEC Championship Games were held at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. From 1994 until 2016, the game was played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. Following the closure and subsequent demolition of the Georgia Dome in 2017, the SEC Championship Game remained in Atlanta, moving to the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium under a ten-year contract. In November 2023, the SEC signed a five-year extension with Mercedes-Benz Stadium with an additional five-year option.\nWith the SEC expanding to 16 teams with the 2024 arrival of Oklahoma and Texas, it announced on June 1, 2023, that it would eliminate its football divisions at that time. Championship games from 2024 forward will feature the top two teams in the conference standings.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2013 the winner of the SEC Championship Game went on to play in the BCS National Championship Game eight straight years, posting a 6\u20132 record. Since 2014, the SEC Championship Game winner has gone on to appear in the College Football Playoff every season, posting a 6\u20131 record in the national semi-final and a 3\u20133 record in the College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\nResults\nResults from all SEC Championship games that have been played. Rankings are from the AP Poll released prior to matchup.\n\n\u2021 2020 game attendance limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nResults by team\nKentucky, Oklahoma, Ole Miss, Texas, Texas A&M, and Vanderbilt have yet to make an appearance in an SEC Championship Game.\n\nHome/away designation\nDuring the championship's divisional era, the team designated as the \"home\" team alternated between division champions.  The designation went to the East champion in even-numbered years and the West champion in odd-numbered years.\nAfter the 2020 contest, the designated \"home\" team is 16\u201313 overall in SEC championship games.\nIn 2009, the West champion, Alabama, was the home team, ending a streak where the SEC West team had worn white jerseys in nine consecutive SEC Championship Games (2000\u20132008). This was because LSU had represented the West in the previous four seasons that the West Division champion was the \"home\" team, and LSU traditionally chooses to wear white jerseys for home games. Additionally, for the next three years (2010\u20132012), the East Division representative wore their home jerseys because in 2011, LSU again represented the West; this happened again from 2018 to 2020 since LSU represented the West in 2019.\n\nRematches\nWhile SEC schools played every other member of their own division during the conference's divisional era, they did not play every member of the opposite division. With the end of divisional play, each SEC member will play only eight of the 15 other teams in the conference. Thus, the SEC Championship Game is not guaranteed to be a rematch of a regular-season game. The SEC Championship game has featured a rematch of a regular-season game a total of seven times (1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2017). The team which won the regular-season game is 5\u20132 in the rematches, the exceptions being 2001 and 2017.\n\nCommon matchups\nMatchups that have occurred more than once:\n\nSelection criteria\nDivision standings were based on each team's overall conference record.  The SEC Commissioner's Regulations requires each football team play all eight conference games in a season in order to be eligible to compete for a divisional title and play in the SEC Championship Game.

It stars Sally Field, Lindsay Crouse, Ed Harris, Ray Baker, Amy Madigan, John Malkovich, Danny Glover, Jerry Haynes and Terry O'Quinn. The film follows Edna Spalding, a young woman during the Great Depression in Texas who is forced to take charge of her farm after the death of her husband and is helped by a motley bunch.\nPlaces in the Heart premiered at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Bear, while Benton won the Silver Bear for Best Director. It  was theatrically released on September 21, 1984, by Tri-Star Pictures to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Benton's screenplay and direction and performances of the cast (particularly of Field, Malkovich and Crouse), while the film grossed $34.9 million against a $9.5 million budget. The film received seven nominations at the 57th Academy Awards including Best Picture and won two: Best Actress (for Field), and Best Original Screenplay.\n\nPlot\nIt's 1935 in Waxahachie, Texas, a small town during the Great Depression. One Sunday afternoon, the sheriff, Royce Spalding, goes to investigate gunshots at the rail yards. A cheerfully drunk black teenager, Wylie, is firing a revolver. He reaches an empty chamber and, thinking the gun is empty, he aims at the sheriff, killing him.  Royce's body is brought home to his widow, Edna, and their children, Frank and Possum. A truckload of vigilantes drags Wylie's body behind them, stopping in front of the Spalding house. Later, Wylie's friends take his body down from a tree. The two men are buried on the same day.\nEdna must now raise her children alone. She is comforted by her sister, Margaret, who helps with the funeral. A drifter and handyman, a black man named Moses \"Moze\" Hadner appears at her door the night of the funeral, asking for work. He offers to plant cotton on her 30 acres, citing his experience. Edna feeds him and sends him on his way. The next morning, she finds him chopping wood in her yard. She makes him breakfast. Moze steals some silver spoons and goes.\nThe bank has a note on the family farm, and the price of cotton is plummeting. The local banker, Albert Denby, insists she needs to sell the farm.\nWhen the police find Moze with her silver, they bring him back to confirm the theft, Edna says she has hired him and explains the spoons. The next day, Edna tells Denby she will not sell the farm. He is appalled that she is taking advice from a black man. Later, he visits the farm and forces her to take his brother-in-law, Will, blinded in World War I, as a paid lodger. \nFrank gets caught smoking at school. Edna is forced into yet another male role previously performed by her husband, as she must punish Frank. Edna gathers instructions from Frank as to the way she should spank him; she hesitates, then delivers the punishment while Moze and Possum empathize from outside. Frank takes his spanking bravely, while Edna confides to Will that she will not do this again and that she dearly misses her husband.\nWill is slow to warm up to Edna's children, but they eventually become close. He rescues her daughter, Possum, during a tornado that levels part of town but leaves the Spalding house standing.\nWayne Lomax, Edna's brother-in-law, has a fine time making love to married schoolteacher Viola Kelsey. The tornado is the last straw for Viola, who tells her husband they must move. Wayne admits the affair to Margaret. She says she won't forgive him this time.\nEdna realizes she cannot make the next payment even if she sells all her cotton. She learns of an Ellis County contest: a $100 cash prize to the farmer who produces the first bale of cotton for the market each season. Edna realizes the prize money plus the proceeds from the sale of her cotton would be enough to save the farm. Moze helps her find the pickers they need to harvest the cotton on time.\nTheir efforts pay off. Edna and Moze find themselves first in line at the wholesaler with the season's first bale of cotton. Moze carefully coaches Edna on how to negotiate with the buyer, and as a result, he is unable to cheat her. Edna makes plans for the future.  Moze is excited, but that night, he is accosted by Ku Klux Klan members. Wielding Royce's gun, Will interrupts the savage beating. He recognizes all the assailants' voices and identifies them. They leave.  Weeping, Moze realizes he must leave the farm or die. He gives Edna a handkerchief that belonged to his mother.\nThe film ends in a dreamlike scene evoking Holy Communion. A choir sings in the modest church, where the pews are mostly empty. During a reading of 1 Corinthians 13, Margaret takes Wayne's hand. The congregation, after filling the pews, partakes in Protestant communion, passing the elements of the sacrifice to each other as the choir sings \"In the Garden\". The camera shows townspeople in the pews who were seen throughout the film, including a woman who died when the tornado overturned her car. Eventually, Moze is shown in the church, though he is long gone; the camera then shows Edna, who passes a communion tray to her dead husband, quietly saying \"Peace of God\"; with the same blessing, he hands it to Wylie, who shot him and was killed in revenge. After Wylie replies, \"Peace of God\", the camera lingers on the two men in contemplation as the hymn ends.\n\nCast\nProduction\nRegarding the unique ending, writer-director Robert Benton explained why he ended an otherwise realistic movie with a fantasy scene incorporating equality, grace and forgiveness, tenets of Christianity:\n\"There are certain things images can explain that words cannot. There is something in the image of the man who has been killed handing the communion plate to the boy who killed him that seems very moving to me in ways I cannot explain. I had the ending before I ever finished the screenplay, although I knew audiences would be confused by it.\"\n\nRelease\nPlaces in the Heart was released in theatres on September 21, 1984. The film was released on DVD on October 9, 2001, by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\nReception\nBox office\nPlaces in the Heart grossed $274,279 in its opening weekend. The film grossed $34.9 million in the US.\n\nCritical response\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 89% based on reviews from 38 critics and a rating average of 8.00/10. The consensus is: \"Places in the Heart is a quiet character piece with grand ambitions that it more than fulfills, thanks to absorbing work from writer-director Robert Benton and a tremendous cast.\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 70% based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nVincent Canby of The New York Times wrote in his review: \"Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.\" Canby called it \"moving and often funny\" and \"a tonic, a revivifying experience right down to the final images\", comparing it to Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Tristana\". Roger Ebert gave the film three of four stars, writing that Benton's \"memories provide the material for a wonderful movie, and he has made it, but unfortunately he hasn't stopped at that.

Founded in 1959, it has a total of eight campuses and twenty-one outreach centers throughout Miami-Dade County. It is the largest college in the Florida College System with more than 100,000 students. The college enrolls a significantly larger number of Hispanic students compared to other colleges and universities in the state of Florida. The college serves a higher number of minority students than any other college in the nation.\n\nHistory\nInitially established on the farm of a county high school, Dade County Junior College and later, Miami Dade Community College\u2014as it was formerly known\u2014had its modest beginnings. Like most organizations at the time, it was a segregated institution. It wasn't until 1962 that desegregation took full effect, and black and white students could share full schedules. In 1963, the first new building was constructed, and Peter Masiko would become president for the next 18 years. As the years progressed, more campuses began opening across the county,including the Kendall Campus and the Wolfson Campus.\nInitially, the college had an open admissions policy, meaning anyone who could afford to pay was allowed to study at the campus. Due to this, the college aimed to improve its academic stance among alumni. To encourage this movement, a Medical Center was built for students in Allied Health and Nursing (RN) programs. As the number of Cuban exiles and refugees began to rise in 1980, an outreach center was built in the city of Hialeah. This allowed refugees and immigrants educational opportunities that they wouldn't be able to achieve otherwise. Another outreach center, the InterAmerican Center, was built to accommodate bilingual education. The Homestead Campus was built in 1990 in Homestead to relieve the concerns of students having to drive to the Kendall Campus In Miami. In the mid-1990s, the college began to rely heavily on the Miami Dade College Foundation as the Florida legislature reduced the state's education budget. The college also had to figure out new ways of recruiting students. It began its \"Successful Alumni\" campaign in the late 1990s, marketing the success of the college's alumni to local prospective students.\nBeginning in 2001, the college implemented a strategic plan to revamp the college and its recruiting goals. In 2002, the college disbanded its Honors Program and created The Honors College for talented high school graduates. The Honors College is a representation of Miami Dade College's most academically gifted students in different fields and was originally based on the three larger campuses (Wolfson, Kendall, and North). In 2006, Miami Dade College surpassed 1.5 million students enrolled throughout its history. In 2007, The Honors College expanded into the Eduardo J. Padron Campus (formerly - InterAmerican Campus) with The Honors College Dual Language Honors Program to tailor to the needs of the growing Spanish-speaking population in the United States as well as abroad. The Dual Language Honors Program opened its doors to bilingual students who wish to continue their careers with professional fluency in the English and Spanish languages. In 2009, The MDC Honors College Dual Language Program earned the merit of Innovation of the Year in the Learning and Teaching Department from the League for Innovation. The Honors College continues to expand and will open its fifth campus at Miami Dade College Homestead Campus Fall 2022. In 2018, Miami Dade was awarded and recognized for its path to economic and social mobility by the Aspen Institute. The award received was the $1 million Aspen Prize.\nIn its first year of operation, The Honors College admitted a cohort of about 75 college freshman located at Wolfson campus. In its second year, it admitted a like-sized cohort of about 75 graduating seniors at the Wolfson campus, North Campus, and Kendall Campus. Among these inaugural classes, international students hailed from countries like Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. By the year 2005, The Honors College had an enrollment total of 400 undergraduate students.\nIn order to qualify for The Honors College, graduating high school seniors or first-year college students must meet the following eligibility criteria:\nMinimum Grade Point Average (GPA):\n\nAt least 3.7 weighed.\nAt least 3.5 unweighed.\nMinimum Standardized Test Scores:\n\nACT: Reading 19, Math 19, English 17\nSAT: Reading 24, Math 24, Writing and Language 25\nAdditionally, consideration for the Dual Language program requires a demonstration of Spanish proficiency. In this case, the requirements are as follows:\n\nHigh School Degree in a Spanish-speaking country.\nAP Spanish Language or AP Spanish Literature: Score of 4 or higher.\nSpanish Translation & Interpretation exam: Score of 55% or higher.\nSpanish Language or Spanish Literature class: Grade of A or B.\nLastly, the application process also involves a standard MDC application and a specialized Honors College application, which requests official high school transcripts, letters of recommendation, and supplemental questions. Qualified students are invited to an interview with the admissions committee.\nOnce students are admitted into the Honors College, they become part of an enriched learning environment with an academically challenging courses, a community of scholars, personalized counseling, competitive scholarships, and transfer opportunities. During their two years at the Honors College, students must complete 60 credits hours, 36 of which are taught by honors faculty, in order to successfully earn an Associate in Arts (A.A.) degree from Miami Dade College. Their tuition is fully funded by the Honors Fellows Award, which covers all in-state tuition and offers a book allowance and stipend given on a semester-by-semester basis. To maintain a spot in the Honors College, students must complete community service hours, leadership courses, and a Colloquia requirement.\nIn 2021, Eduardo Padron was succeeded by Madeline Pumariega as president of the college.

The screenplay, written by Gregory Allen Howard, is loosely based on the true story of coach Herman Boone, portrayed by Denzel Washington, and his attempt to integrate the T. C. Williams High School (now Alexandria City High School) football team in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971. Will Patton portrays Bill Yoast, Boone's assistant coach. Real-life athletes Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell are portrayed by Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris, respectively.\nThe film was co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films and released by Buena Vista Pictures. On September 19, 2000, the film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records. It features songs by several recording artists including Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bob Dylan, The Hollies, Marvin Gaye, James Taylor, The Temptations,  Cat Stevens, and Steam.\nRemember the Titans had a budget of $30 million and premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on September 29, 2000. It grossed an estimated $115.6 million in the U.S., and $136.8 million worldwide. Reception was not so favorable upon release, but has become appreciated over the years. The film is often listed among the best football films.\n\nPlot\nIn 1981, a group of former football coaches and players attend a funeral for  a former football player. \nTen years earlier in the summer of 1971, head coach Bill Yoast of the newly integrated T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, is leading his white players in summer workouts. He is informed that Herman Boone, a black head coach originally hired to coach the city's black high school football team, has been assigned to his coaching staff instead. Then, in an attempt to placate rising racial tensions and the fact that all other high schools in Alexandria are \"white only\" (despite the abolition of racial segregation in public schools), the school district decides to name Boone the head coach. Boone refuses, believing it is unfair to Yoast, a successful coach who is nominated to the Virginia High School Hall of Fame, but relents after seeing what it means to the black community. When Yoast tells his white players that he will accept a head coach position elsewhere, they pledge to boycott the team if he is not their coach. Dismayed at the prospect of the students losing their chances at scholarships, Yoast changes his mind and decides to accept Boone's offer to serve as his defensive coordinator.\nBoone holds his first team meeting with mostly black students in the school gymnasium but is interrupted by the arrival of Yoast and several white students. Yoast informs Boone of his decision, but Boone warns Yoast that it is his team and he will not tolerate Yoast undermining him. On August 15, the players journey to Gettysburg College for training camp. Early on, the black and white team members frequently clash in racially-motivated conflicts, especially between captains Gerry Bertier (white) and Julius Campbell (black). However, through forceful coaching, rigorous training, and a motivational early-morning run to the Gettysburg National Cemetery followed by an emotional speech by Boone, the team comes together and returns as a united group. Before their first game, Boone is told by a member of the school board that if he loses even a single game, he will be dismissed. Subsequently, the Titans go through the season undefeated while battling racial prejudice and slowly gaining support from the community.\nJust before the state semi-finals, Yoast is told by the chairman of the school board that they have arranged for the Titans to lose so that Boone will be dismissed and Yoast reinstated as head coach. During the game, the referees make several biased calls against the Titans. Upon seeing the chairman and other board members in the audience looking on with satisfaction, Yoast marches onto the field to warn the head referee that if the game is not officiated fairly, he will expose the scandal to the press. After this, the Titans shut out their opponents and advance to the state championship, but Yoast is told by the infuriated chairman that his actions in saving Boone's job have resulted in the loss of his Hall of Fame nomination.\nThat night, while celebrating the victory, Gerry is severely injured in a car accident and is paralyzed from the waist down. Despite the loss of the All-American linebacker, the team mounts a comeback in the fourth quarter of the state championship and wins the title.\nTen years later, Gerry dies in another car crash caused by a drunk driver after having won the gold medal in shot put in the Paralympic Games. It is his funeral the former football coaches and players were attending in the opening scene. Julius, who Gerry's mother formerly disliked, is now holding her hand as he leads the team in a mournful rendition of \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\".\nIn the epilogue, descriptions show the players' and coaches' activities after the events in 1971. Coach Boone coached the Titans for five more seasons before retirement, while Coach Yoast assisted Boone for four more years, retiring from coaching in 1990; the two coaches became good friends. After Gerry's death, the gymnasium at T.C. Williams High was renamed after him. Julius would work for the city of Alexandria and remain friends with Gerry until his death.\n\nCast\nProduction\nFilming\nFilming locations for the motion picture included the campus of Dallas, Georgia at Paulding County High School, where the home games were filmed. Berry College in Rome, Georgia, Etowah High School in Woodstock, and in Atlanta, Georgia including Henry Grady High School and Druid Hills High School which both filled in for T.C. Williams High School. Practice scenes were filmed at Clarkston High School in Clarkston Georgia. Additionally, some of the championship game scenes were filmed at the Sprayberry High School football stadium in East Marietta, Georgia.\n\nHistorical accuracy\nAs with any movie that is not a documentary film but is rather \"based on a true story\", it has strayed from the actual events that had occurred on many occasions to add new dramatic elements of teamwork, commitment, and friendship to the film.\n\nAlexandria City Schools were desegregated in 1959 and T.C. Williams was created by merging three racially integrated schools.\nThe Titans were ranked second in the nation at the end of the 1971 season, finishing 13\u20130. However, despite the movie showing multiple close games, most games were actually blowouts, with nine of their 13 wins being shutouts.\nIn the movie, Coach Boone states, \"We are not like all the other schools in this conference, they're all white. They don't have to worry about race. We do.\" This is false as well; all the schools the Titans faced were integrated years before.\nWhile the team is at camp, it shows Coach Boone waking them up at 3:00 a.m. to go for a run. This did not occur; neither did his speech at Gettysburg. The team did go on a tour of Gettysburg, although it was not as dramatic as portrayed in the film.\nRonnie \"Sunshine\" Bass was far from being the only one with long hair at the time. Even Gerry Bertier had long hair. But in interviews, Bass said, \"I'll say for the record my hair was never that long.\" He also says the kiss with Gerry never happened.\nThe climax of the movie is a fictionalized 1971 AAA state championship football game between T. C. Williams and George C. Marshall High School. The dramatic license taken in the movie was to convert what was actually a mid-season match-up between T. C. Williams and Marshall into a made-for-Hollywood state championship. In reality, the Marshall game was the toughest game T. C. Williams played all year. As depicted in the movie, the real Titans won the Marshall game on a fourth down come-from-behind play at the very end of the game. The actual state championship (against Andrew Lewis High School of Salem) was a 27\u20130 blowout, played at Victory Stadium in Roanoke.\nBertier's car accident took place on December 11, 1971, after (rather than before) the season-ending State Championship game. He had been at a banquet honoring the team for their undefeated season. After the banquet, Bertier borrowed his mother's new 1971 Chevrolet Camaro. Bertier lost control of the Camaro and crashed (the movie shows him getting broadsided). The cause of the accident was determined to be a mechanical failure in the engine mounts.\nSheryl Yoast (who died in 1996 of an undetected heart condition at the age of 34) was not an only child as portrayed but had three sisters. Her oldest sister Bonnie was in college, her second oldest Angela went to a different high school, and her younger sister Deidre was only three years old in 1971.\nThe film omits that in 1979 Boone was relieved of his coaching duties by the Principal who felt \"a change was needed.\" The principal denied it was related to any allegations of player abuse which were never substantiated. Boone continued to work as the head of the school's physical education department.\n\nMusic\nOn September 19, 2000, the soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records. The film score was orchestrated by musician Trevor Rabin and features music composed by various artists. From the instrumental score, Rabin's track \"Titans Spirit\", was the only cue (of the 12 composed) added to the soundtrack. It is also the only piece of music on the soundtrack album not to have been previously released.\n\"Titans Spirit\" is a seven-minute instrumental. It has been used on numerous sports telecasts, particularly those on NBC, which has utilized the score during its closing credits for each Olympic Games since 2002, as well as the final closing credits montage ending their 12-year run of NBA coverage in 2002. The song was also played as veteran New York Mets players crossed home plate during the closing ceremonies at Shea Stadium, and as the New York Yankees were awarded their rings from their 2009 World Series championship. The New Jersey Devils also used this song during the jersey number retirement ceremonies for Scott Stevens, Ken Daneyko, Scott Niedermayer, Martin Brodeur and Patrik Eli\u00e1\u0161. In 2018, at the conclusion of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the song was used during the Washington Capitals' Stanley Cup celebration as captain Alexander Ovechkin lifted the Cup in Las Vegas.\nIt was also used during the 2008 Democratic National Convention to accompany the celebration and fireworks at Invesco Field after future president Barack Obama gave his nomination acceptance speech, and was also used immediately following his victory speech upon winning the 2008 Presidential Election.\nAlthough not included on the soundtrack, \"Them Changes\" by Buddy Miles is heard playing early on in the film.\n\nSoundtrack\nCertifications\nRelease\nHome media\nFollowing its release in theaters, the Region 1 widescreen and Pan and scan edition of the motion picture was released on VHS and DVD in the United States on March 20, 2001. A Special Edition widescreen format of the film was released on March 20, 2001, along with a widescreen Director's cut on March 14, 2006.\nA restored widescreen hi-definition Blu-ray version was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on September 4, 2007. Special features include backstage feature audio commentary with director Boaz Yakin, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and writer Gregory Allen Howard, feature audio commentary with real-life coaches Herman Boone and Bill Yoast, \"Remember The Titans: An inspirational journey behind the scenes\" hosted by Lynn Swann, \"Denzel Becomes Boone,\" \"Beating The Odds\"; Deleted scenes; Movie Showcase and seamless menus.\n\nReception\nBox office\nRemember the Titans opened strongly at the U.S. box office, grossing $26,654,715 in its first weekend and staying within the top five for six weeks. The film debuted at the number one spot, but was quickly overtaken by Meet the Parents a week later. It eventually went on to gross an estimated $115,654,751 in the U.S., and $136,706,684 worldwide.\n\nCritical response\nAmong mainstream critics in the U.S., Remember the Titans received generally positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 71% of 137 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.3/10. The site's consensus states: \"An inspirational crowd-pleaser with a healthy dose of social commentary, Remember the Titans may be predictable, but it's also well-crafted and features terrific performances.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to critics' reviews, the film received a score of 48 based on 32 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.\nJames Berardinelli writing for ReelViews, called the film \"relentlessly manipulative and hopelessly predictable\" but noted that it was \"a notch above the average entry in part because its social message (even if it is soft-peddled [sic]) creates a richer fabric than the usual cloth from which this kind of movie is cut.\" Describing some pitfalls, Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer said that \"beneath its rah-rah rhetoric and pigskin proselytizing, it's no more provocative or thoughtful than a Hallmark Hall of Fame film or, for that matter, a Hallmark greeting card. Its heart is in the right place, but it has no soul.\" Wilonsky however was quick to admit \"The film's intentions are noble, but its delivery is ham-fisted and pretentious; you can't deny the message, but you can loathe the messenger without feeling too guilty about it.\"\n\nTodd McCarthy, writing in Variety, said, \"As simplistic and drained of complexity as the picture is, it may well appeal to mainstream audiences as an 'if only it could be like this' fantasy, as well as on the elemental level of a boot camp training film, albeit a PG-rated one with all the cuss words removed.\" Roger Ebert, in the Chicago Sun-Times, viewed the film as \"a parable about racial harmony, yoked to the formula of a sports movie,\" adding, \"Victories over racism and victories over opposing teams alternate so quickly that sometimes we're not sure if we're cheering for tolerance or touchdowns. Real life is never this simple, but then that's what the movies are for\".\nIn the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle wrote that the film reminds the viewer that \"it's possible to make a sentimental drama that isn't sickening \u2014\u200a and a sports movie that transcends cliches.\" Columnist Bob Grimm of the Sacramento News & Review, somewhat praised the film, writing, \"The film is quite lightweight for the subject matter, but Washington and company make it watchable.\" Some detractors like Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"Denzel Washington should have held out for a better script before he signed on to star in Remember the Titans, but you can see why he wanted to do the movie: He gets to play Martin Luther King Jr. and Vince Lombardi rolled into one nostalgically omnipotent tough-love saint.\" Jeff Vice of the Deseret News admitted that although the film contained dialogue that was \"corny, clich\u00e9d, and downright cheesy at times,\" as well as how it relayed its message in one of the \"most predictable, heavy-handed manners we've seen in a movie in years\", the film \"serves as a reminder of how much goodness there is inside people, just waiting for the right person to bring it out.\" He also viewed the casting as top-notch, saying that it helped to have a \"rock-solid foundation in the form of leading-man Denzel Washington\" at the helm.\n\nAccolades\nThe film was nominated and won several awards in 2000\u20132001.\n\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers - Nominated\n\nSee also\nList of American football films\nCoach Carter\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nRemember the Titans at IMDb \nRemember the Titans at AllMovie\nRemember the Titans at Rotten Tomatoes\nRemember the Titans at Metacritic \nRemember the Titans at Box Office Mojo"], "Ground_truth": "The Disney Movie, \"Remember the Titans,\" is based on the true story of a high school football team.

The results of this test can identify certain genetic diseases and can determine approximate risks for cardiovascular disease, certain forms of pancreatitis, and other diseases.\nLipid panels are usually ordered as part of a physical exam, along with other panels such as the complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP).\n\nComponents\nA lipid profile report typically includes:\n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL)\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL)\nTotal triglycerides\nTotal cholesterol\nLDL is not usually actually measured, but calculated from the other three using the Friedewald equation. A laboratory can optionally calculate the two extra values from the report:\n\nVery low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)\nCholesterol:HDL ratio\n\nProcedure and indication\nRecommendations for cholesterol testing come from the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, and are based on many large clinical studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study.\nFor healthy adults with no cardiovascular risk factors, the ATP III guidelines recommend screening once every five years. A lipid profile may also be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins.\nIn the pediatric and adolescent population, lipid testing is not routinely performed. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommend that children aged 9\u201311 be screened once for severe cholesterol abnormalities. This screening can be valuable to detect genetic diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia that can be lethal if not treated early.\nTraditionally, most laboratories have required patients to fast for 9\u201312 hours before screening. However, studies have questioned the utility of fasting before lipid panels, and some diagnostic labs routinely accept non-fasting samples.\n\nMethods\nFriedewald\nTypically the laboratory measures only three quantities: total cholesterol; HDL; Triglycerides. A typical procedure used by NHANES 2004 uses the following measurement methods:\n\nTotal cholesterol is measured using a mixture of enzymes. First an esterase converts cholesterol esters into cholesterol and free fatty acid. Then an oxidase oxidizes the cholesterol, producing a H2O2 side-product that changes the color of a dye. The amount of oxidation can be precisely quantified by light absorbance at 500 nm.\nTriglyceride concentration is also measured using an enzyme mixture. A lipase releases glycerol from the molecules, which gets oxidized by another enzyme while producing H2O2. The same color-change follows.\nHDL is measured in two steps. First a special reagent is added to the serum that binds apoB-containing lipoprotein particles, shielding them from the enzymes in the next step. Then a mixture of PEGylated enzymes is added with dye. The chemical reaction is the same as the total cholesterol measurement, except that the enzymes are blocked from acting on non-HDL lipoproteins by the reagent and their own PEG tails.\nFrom these three data LDL may be calculated. According to Friedewald's equation:\n\n[LDL]  =  [Total cholesterol] \u2212 [HDL] \u2212  [Triglycerides] /5\nOther calculations of LDL from those same three data have been proposed which yield some significantly different results.\nVLDL can be defined as the total cholesterol that is neither HDL nor LDL. With that definition, Friedewald's equation yields:\n\n[VLDL]  =   [Triglycerides] /5\nThe alternative calculations mentioned above may yield significantly different values for VLDL.\nThe Friedewald method is reasonably reliable for the majority of patients, but is notably inaccurate in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (> 400 mg/dL or 4.5 mmol/L). It also underestimates LDL-C in patients with low LDL-C (< 25 mg/dL or 0.6 mmol/L). It does not take into account intermediate-density lipoprotein.\nA \"Martin/Hopkins\" variation that takes into how triglycerides-to-VLDL ratio tends to vary with other parameters appears more reliable and accurate.\n\nAll-direct\nEvery part of the lipid panel can be measured directly using ultracentrifugation, which is the gold standard.  This type of measurement involves no errors from estimation and can also measure IDL-C and Lp(a)-C levels. Fully direct measurement is more costly, however.\nLaboratories may also use proprietrary tests for \"direct chemical LDL-C\" which require no prior separation by centrifugation. These tests are not yet standardized in US and Europe and lack validation. A specific version of the test seems popular in Japan, however. A number of other LDL-C determination methods have been used in the past or have been proposed for future use.\n\nImplications\nThis test is used to identify dyslipidemia (various disturbances of cholesterol and triglyceride levels), many forms of which are recognized risk factors for cardiovascular disease and rarely pancreatitis.\nA total cholesterol reading can be used to assess an individual's risk for heart disease; however, it should not be relied upon as the only indicator. The individual components that make up total cholesterol reading\u2014LDL, HDL, and VLDL\u2014are also important in measuring risk.\nFor instance, someone's total cholesterol may be high, but this may be due to very high HDL (\"good cholesterol\") cholesterol levels,\u2014which can help prevent heart disease (the test is mainly concerned with high LDL, or \"bad cholesterol\" levels). So, while a high total cholesterol level may help give an indication that there is a problem with cholesterol levels, the components that make up total cholesterol should also be measured.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nTalwalkar PG, Sreenivas CG, Gulati A, Baxi H (July 2013). \"Journey in guidelines for lipid management: From adult treatment panel (ATP)-I to ATP-III and what to expect in ATP-IV\".

The program has seen success throughout the years, culminating in a national championship in 1959 under coach Pete Newell, and the team has reached the final four two other times, in 1946 and 1960.\nThe team plays its home games at Haas Pavilion, which was long known as Harmon Gym before being heavily renovated with money donated in part by the owners of Levi Strauss & Co. The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through renovations which displaced the team for two seasons.\n\nHistory\nThe Golden Bears first played basketball intercollegiately in 1907 and began full conference play in 1915. The 1920s was the dominant decade for Cal basketball, as the Bears won 6 conference titles under coaches E.H. Wright and Nibs Price. Cal was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1926\u201327 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nNibs Price coached Cal with great success for 30 years from 1924 to 1954, earning a 449\u2013294 total record, many single season winning records, and an additional 3 conference titles in the 1930s and 1940s.\nCal reached the pinnacle of the sport during the tenure of Pete Newell, who was head coach from 1955 to 1960. The Golden Bears earned the conference title four out of his five years and in 1959, won the NCAA title. In Newell's last year, Cal came close to another NCAA title, but lost to Ohio State in the final.\nThe fortunes of Cal men's basketball would never be the same after Newell. The next quarter-century was mostly a dreary one for the program, despite having players such as Butch Hays (1981\u20131984) and Kevin Johnson (1983\u20131987) who both set school records for assists. From 1960 to 1985, the Bears tallied only two winning seasons in conference play. Lou Campanelli served as head coach from 1986 to 1993. The highlight of this era was a 75\u201367 victory over UCLA in 1986 that ended a 25-year, 52 game losing streak to the Bruins. Campanelli in his first season took the Golden Bears to the 1986 National Invitation Tournament, the first post season appearance of any sort since 1960.  In 1990, Campanelli led the Golden Bears to their first NCAA Tournament in 30 years.\nCal achieved much better success in the 1990s, qualifying for the NCAA tournament five times with future NBA players Jason Kidd (the Golden Bears all-time assists leader) and Lamond Murray, as well as future perennial All-Pro NFL tight end Tony Gonzalez in the early and mid 1990s and Sean Lampley and Shareef Abdur-Rahim in the late 1990s. Cal also won the 1999 National Invitation Tournament, with a thrilling 61\u201360 victory over Clemson in the title game.\nThis success came amid a brief period of turmoil in the mid-1990s. Campanelli was fired midway through the 1992\u201393 season after athletic director Bob Bockrath heard Campanelli berate his players with obscenity-laden tirades following two losses. Assistant Todd Bozeman finished out the season, and was named permanent head coach after leading the Bears to an upset of two-time defending champion Duke in the NCAA Tournament. Bozeman himself was pushed out two months before the 1996\u201397 season after it emerged that he'd funneled $30,000 over two years to the parents of star recruit Jelani Gardner so they could make the drive to see their son play. Ultimately, the Bears were docked four scholarships over two years and forfeited the entire 1994\u201395 season and all but one game of the 1995\u201396 season.\nBen Braun took over for Bozeman just before the 1996\u201397 season. Inheriting a team expected to be barely competitive in the Pac-10, Braun led the Bears to a second-place finish and took them all the way to the Sweet 16. During Braun's 12-year tenure, Cal qualified for the NCAA tournament three straight times in the 2000s and six times overall. However, after finishing near the bottom of the Pac-10 for the second straight year, Braun was dismissed in late March 2008. The former coach of rival Stanford, Mike Montgomery, succeeded Braun. In his first year the Bears finished tied for third in the Pac-10 and made it to the NCAA tournament, where they were eliminated in the first round to the Maryland Terrapins.\nIn 2006, the Golden Bears reached their first Pacific Life Pac-10 Men's Basketball Tournament championship game. Power forward Leon Powe grabbed a tournament-record 20 rebounds against USC in the first round and then scored a tournament-record 41 points in a double-overtime victory versus Oregon in the semi-finals. Despite California's 71\u201352 loss to UCLA in the final game, Powe was named Most Valuable Player for the tournament.\nIn Montgomery's second season, the Bears won their first conference title in 50 years. The team, featuring four seniors as starters, only lost one game at Haas Pavilion but had a rough non-conference schedule featuring losses to elite teams such as Kansas, Ohio State, and Syracuse, which quickly knocked them out of the national rankings after being ranked #13 in the pre-season. Despite losing the Pac-10 tournament, and questions on whether even the conference champion of a down Pac-10 conference would receive an at-large bid to the tournament, the Bears qualified for their second straight NCAA bid as a #8 seed. They one-upped their previous season by winning their first round matchup against the Louisville Cardinals but fell to the eventual national champions, Duke, in the second round. Senior Jerome Randle finished the season and his career as Cal's all-time leading scorer. The highlight of Montgomery's last season as the head coach for Cal was the signature win at home against then undefeated, No. 1 Arizona. In thrilling fashion, senior guard Justin Cobbs hits the game-winning jumper with 0.9 on the clock for a 60\u201358 victory.\nMike Montgomery announced his retirement shortly after the 2013\u201314 season's culmination, resulting in the hiring of Cuonzo Martin. The Bears went 18\u201315 in Martin's first season as head coach.  On April 13, 2015, 5-star power forward Ivan Rabb of Bishop O'Dowd High School announced he would attend Cal. A little more than 2 weeks later, 5-star small forward Jaylen Brown announced he too would attend Cal, making this recruiting class the best in Cal history. While the team had a solid regular season, earning a #4 seed in the NCAA tournament, they were upset in the first round by Hawaii.  After three seasons, Martin announced his resignation to become the head coach at Missouri.  Shortly thereafter, Martin's assistant coach Wyking Jones became Cal's 17th head basketball coach. Jones coached for only two years, with the team finishing in the last place of the Pac-12 during both seasons.  Former Georgia head coach  Mark Fox was named Cal's 18th head basketball coach in 2019.\n\nCoaches\nPostseason\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Golden Bears have appeared in 19 NCAA Tournaments.

It crosses the central business district from west to east, beginning at the corner of Claremont Avenue and de Maisonneuve Boulevard in Westmount, and ending at the Grace Dart Extended Care Centre by Assomption metro station, where it folds back into Notre-Dame Street. It also traverses Ville-Marie, passing just east of Viau in Mercier\u2013Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. The street is 11.2 km long, and considered the backbone of Downtown Montreal.\nA series of interconnected office tower basements and shopping complexes line the street, parallel to the largest segments of Montreal's underground city. Educational institutions located on or near the street include Concordia University, McGill University, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, Dawson College and LaSalle College.\nNine metro stations serve as access to Sainte-Catherine Street, whereby it passes through residential neighbourhoods, the Quartier des spectacles and the downtown core. It also offers ease of access to the Underground Pedestrian Network.\n\nHistory\nSainte-Catherine Street has been a major landmark in Montreal for over a century. However, it is not known exactly when it was built as it was never part of a city plan. Instead, it just happened to be a highly frequented street. The street particularly began to grow after 1736.\nAt the end of the 19th century, English merchants set up shop along the western portion of the street. This led to a surge in department stores in Philips Square. Sainte-Catherine Street East held home to industry in the 1870s. Traditionally francophone, it became a commercial artery during this time. This is still seen today, with large stores, entertainment venues, cinemas and theatres continuing to attract commercial traffic.\nIt is not known exactly where the name 'Sainte-Catherine Street' originated, but there are three prevalent theories: The first theory, by Cl\u00e9phas Saint-Aubin, states the name intends to honour Catherine de Bourbonnais (the suspected illegitimate child of King Louis XV). Another theory is that it was named after Catholic Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The final theory is that the street was named by Jacques Viger after one of his daughters-in-law, Catherine Elizabeth. In its early years, Sainte-Catherine was known as 'Sainte-Genevieve,' or 'Saint-Gabriel'. During this time, it was common for street names to change frequently.\nThroughout the 18th century, Montreal had no municipal council. All administrative issues pertaining to roads were the responsibility of the Justices of the Peace. In the late 18th century, the Roads Act of 1796 allowed justices to approve or deny road construction and funding for roads. Further, landowners and farmers were pressured to pay for the construction of streets. Road inspectors, like Montreal's first mayor, Jacques Viger, were appointed; their responsibilities were to ensure roads like Sainte-Catherine Street were level, drained and aligned properly, and adequately paved.\n\nConstruction and development\nSainte-Catherine Street was never formally planned, and as a result, it historically grew in different sections. There were four distinct stages of development:\nThe first stage, from Saint-Alexandre Street to Sanguinet Road, saw significant growth between 1758 and 1788. The street was 24 feet wide at this time.\n\nThe second stage started in 1820 and ended in 1860. The eastern part of the street was extended past Sanguinet to Panet, and the western section of the street was extended from Saint-Alexandre Street to McGill College Avenue in 1840. In the 1850s, Sainte-Catherine shouldered McGill College Avenue, past De la Montagne and Guy Street until it reached Atwater Avenue.\nThe third stage followed on from 1860, and lasted until 1890. In 1872, Sainte-Catherine advanced west to Greene Avenue, pushing past Victoria Avenue in the 1880s. In the east, the street extended to De Lorimier Avenue and Fullum Road by 1863\u2014where it reaches to Du Havre in the next couple of years.\nThe fourth and final stage of development occurred from 1890 to 1910. By 1890, there had been sections that had been built in the neighborhoods of Hochelaga and Maisonneuve, and in 1910, the street stretched to Vimont Street.\nIn the 1950s, in order to complete the entirety of the street, segments were added on either end of the street. In the east it hooked into Notre-Dame Street, and in the west it joined with De Maisonneauve Boulevard.\n\nGrowing popularity\nBy the end of the 19th century, Sainte-Catherine became known as the entertainment hub of Montreal.\nBy 1850, horse-drawn streetcars habitually lined the street. Later in 1864, the first electric-powered tramway\u2014provided by the Montreal City Passenger Railway\u2014was introduced . This allowed workers to get to and from their jobs in other parts of the city, as well as retail workers to the many department stores that had started up on Sainte-Catherine following World War I. This included stores like Scoggie's, Goodwin's, Morgan's, Eaton's, Simpson's, Ogilvy's and Dupuis, as well as jewellery stores like Birks.\nIn 1890, evening entertainment began to boom, with both English and French theatres, as well as the Academy of Music, lining the street near the intersection with Victoria Avenue.\n\nRetailers\nSt. Catherine Street has been home to many of Montreal's prominent department stores, including such former retailers as Eaton's, Morgan's, Simpson's and Dupuis Fr\u00e8res.\nToday, the Henry Morgan Building is home to Hudson's Bay Company, which acquired Morgan's in 1960. The Simpson's building is now shared by the Simons department store and a multiplex cinema, while Eaton's was converted to the Complexe Les Ailes. Dupuis Fr\u00e8res, located further east at St. Catherine and St. Hubert, is now a shopping mall and office complex. The Ogilvy's department store remains a fixture on St. Catherine Street, although it is now a collection of boutiques rather than a single store.\nOther major retailers along the street include an Apple Store, AVEDA Experience Centre, Indigo Books and Music, Archambault, La Senza, Best Buy, Roots, Adidas, Puma, Guess, Parasuco, Zara, and an H&M flagship store at the corner of Peel and St. Catherine. Additionally, many of Montreal's most prominent shopping complexes, including the Eaton Centre, Complexe Les Ailes, Place Montreal Trust, Promenades Cath\u00e9drale, les Cours Mont-Royal, the Complexe Desjardins, Place Dupuis, Place Alexis Nihon, the Faubourg Sainte-Catherine and Westmount Square are all located along the street.\nThe Montreal Forum, once home to the Montreal Canadiens, is also located on St. Catherine Street at Atwater Street. Since its opening, it has been turned into a shopping and movie theatre complex, called the 'Pepsi Forum'. Due to the Forum's presence on this street, St. Catherine was used as the parade route for locals when the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup. This was once referred to as \"the usual route\" by Mayor Jean Drapeau, during the Canadiens' dynasties of the mid-century, when a win would frequently occur.\nThe street's segment in the district of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is also an important commercial area in that neighbourhood.\n\nCar-free events\nFor one weekend in July every year, Saint-Catherine Street hosts Canada's largest open-air sidewalk sale. It is estimated that over 300,000 people visit the downtown during this event. 2 km (1 mi) of the street between Jeanne-Mance Street and St. Mark is closed to vehicular traffic, and vendors from nearby shopping centres bring out their sale merchandise. There is also live entertainment along the street.\n\nTransit\nThe Green line of the Montreal Metro was built to serve Sainte-Catherine Street; however, to avoid disrupting traffic on the street, it was built one block to the north, under parts of Burnside Place which later became de Maisonneuve Boulevard. However, Atwater, Berri-UQAM, Beaudry and Papineau stations all have entrances located on Sainte-Catherine street. Bus service is provided by the STM's 15 Sainte-Catherine and 34 Sainte-Catherine lines which both operate 7 days a week.\n\nCulture\nMontreal's Place des Arts, the city's primary concert venue, is located on Saint Catherine, Jeanne-Mance and Saint-Urbain streets. This is in the city's Quartier des Spectacles entertainment district. The street was once home to many now-abandoned cinemas, such as the Loews, Palace, Capitol, Cin\u00e9ma de Paris, York, Ouimetoscope and the Seville Theatre. This includes the now-demolished Montreal Spectrum music venue.\n\nPlaces of worship\nSainte-Catherine is also home to Christ Church Cathedral, the only church in Canada that sits atop a shopping mall, Promenades Cath\u00e9drale. Another prominent church, Saint James United Church, has recently had its concealing fa\u00e7ade of commercial buildings removed. Other churches on the street include St. James the Apostle Anglican Church.\n\nGay Village\nMontreal's Gay Village (French: Le Village gai) extends along Sainte-Catherine Street in the east end of downtown between Saint-Hubert and Papineau. Beaudry Metro station, on the Green Line, provides the most convenient access to the Village and sports a permanent rainbow decoration on its fa\u00e7ade.\nFor most of the summer\u2014mid-May till mid-September\u2014Sainte-Catherine Street is completely closed to vehicular traffic through the Gay Village. This makes it one large pedestrian area allowing stores to sell outside and restaurants and bars to serve on large, open-air terrasses.\nSummer is also punctuated with special events and festivals, such as the art festival FIMA, Festival International Montr\u00e9al en arts, Pride Celebrations and Divers/Cit\u00e9.\n\nParks and Green Spaces\nIn addition to Phillips and Cabot squares, there are a few green spaces on Sainte-Catherine Street: Dorchester-Clarke and Landsdowne parks in Westmount, Place \u00c9milie-Gamelin next to the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM), Jos -Montferrand, Edmond-Hamelin Park and Morgan Park.\n\nGallery\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "St. Catherine Street, the primary commercial artery of Downtown Montreal is 7 miles or 11.2 km long.", "Answer": "Approximately 11.2 kilometers", "Confidence": 0.85, "rouge_score": 0.1818181818181818}, {"Id": 0, "Original_question": "Where is the cash explosion tv show taped?", "New_Question": "Where is the Cash Explosion TV show filmed?", "Documnet": ["Cash Explosion, (or simply C.E. since 2017) known as Cash Explosion: Double Play from 1989 until 2012, is the official Ohio Lottery TV game show, which is broadcast on television stations throughout Ohio. The show originated in Cleveland and is now taped by Mills James Productions in Columbus, Ohio.\nCash Explosion originally aired from February 7, 1987, to September 30, 2006, at which point the Ohio Lottery replaced it with Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich. However, slumping ticket sales and poor ratings prompted the return of the Cash Explosion format a year later, on October 6, 2007, and it has remained on the air since.\nCash Explosion is the longest-running state lottery based game show, surpassing California's The Big Spin, which ended its run on January 10, 2009, after 23 years and 1,213 episodes. As of September 27, 2014, Cash Explosion has run for 26 years and 1,433 episodes.\nAs of 2016, Cash Explosion is the only weekly lottery game show airing in the United States.\n\nHosts\nBob Grossi (then a weather anchor at WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio) was the original host, and was replaced in 1988 by Cleveland radio personality Paul Tapi\u00e9. Tapi\u00e9 left the show for a few months in 2000. During this, Safe Auto spokesman Michael Armstrong took over. Sharon Bicknell was the co-host from the beginning until February 2004, returning in 2007 until the present. Michelle Duda and Leilani Barrett took over as hosts in February 2004, and remained through the end of the first run. Regular lottery drawing hosts Karen Harris and Bob Becker (deceased) substituted on various occasions. John E. Douglas (Cleveland) has the longest run as the \"off stage announcer\" from 1989 until 2006; Douglas died in July 2016. Beneatha Barkley joined the lottery host rotation in April 2003 which lasted until October in which she was replaced by Karen Kawolics. Cherie McClain joined the lottery drawing hosting team in 2006.\nFollowing its October 2007 return, David McCreary, a comedy magician who had previously hosted Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich, became the new host with Bicknell returning, and McClain also joining the cast. Becker, Harris and Kawlolics served as rotating lottery drawing hosts until Harris and Becker\u2019s retirements in 2011 and 2013 respectively. Eric Parks replaced the retired hosts at the beginning of 2014 and served until 2019.\nBarb McCann was Cash Explosion's Special Correspondent from 2007\u20132008. McCann won a contest during the run of Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich in which viewers voted on their favorite co-host among those auditioning.\nFollowing the 30th Anniversary Special, Alissa Henry (a reporter with WSYX-TV in Columbus) became the new co-host (alongside McCreary), replacing both Bicknell and McClain which both move to rotating lottery drawing hosts. At the same time, the show is alternatively called C.E. McCreary became the shows announcer or in some cases Henry (if McCreary is hosting). David Saglila replaced Parks in 2020.\n\nFirst format (1987\u20131989)\nFirst round\nSeven contestants, each of whom submitted a Cash Explosion scratchcard ticket with three matching \"ENTRY\" symbols, competed in a race to reach the top of an eleven-step pyramid in order to win $50,000. The losing contestants were each given $1,000.\nEach contestant had a box of cards in front of them, numbered \u20132 to 3, with no zero cards. On their turn each contestant drew a card, then moved up or down the pyramid by the number of spaces indicated. The first person to land on the final square by exact count won $50,000. If a contestant returned to the start line at any point in the game, they were eliminated from the game.\nIn every contestant's track was a randomly designated bonus square. Landing on it gave the contestant the option to leave the game and take a new car or stay in the game. Regardless of their decision, once two bonus squares had been revealed, all other bonus squares were voided.\nToward the end of this format, each contestant was staked $1,000. For each legitimate move up or down the track, the contestant won/lost $50 (i.e., a 2 was worth $100 in addition to moving up the track 2 spaces; a \u20132 decreased their score by $100). Still later, moving up or down was worth $100 per move. Reaching the goal augmented the contestant's total to $50,000, while the others could keep their cash or trade it away for a spin of the wheel in the second round. Those eliminated by penalty still received $1,000.\n\nSecond round\nThe contestants who had not been eliminated during the course of the game, whether by choice (with the bonus squares) or by penalty, were eligible to trade their winnings and spin a wheel containing various amounts of cash (originally cash and prizes from a differently-built wheel). The odds of spinning something worth more than $1,000 were high, so contestants often spun the wheel.\n\nSecond format (1989\u20132006; 2007\u20132017)\nSemifinal game\nCash Explosion Double Play (1989\u20132009)\nFour people competed in the Semifinal game. The contestants faced a 24-space game board with six columns of four rows. The columns were labeled D-O-U-B-L-E and the rows labeled P-L-A-Y. On a contestant's turn, the columns randomly flashed and the contestant pressed their button to stop the lights on a column, then picked one of the four rows in that column, winning whatever money was behind the space represented by that combination.\nThe values on the board ranged from $1,000 and $3,200. Also on the board were two spaces marked \"double\". If chosen, the contestant received another turn and whatever they land on was doubled; if the second pick was also a double, the contestant received a third turn, quadrupling the money found. The third special square was a bonus card, which not only contained a money amount, but also a bonus prize (originally a new car, later $25,000). Originally the contestant had to choose whether he or she wanted the bonus (dropping out of further play if they took it) or the money. Under this rule, the show gained national coverage in August 1990 when contestant Pamela Richards turned down a $17,600 Honda Accord because she was a member of a labor union. She at the time worked at Toledo Precision Machining, a Chrysler Corporation subsidiary plant of Risingsun, for 23 years before appearing on the show. Ultimately enough, she immediately won $6,400 after her decision. However, by 1993 contestants were simply awarded both the car and the cash amount hidden behind it.\nFrom 2000\u20132004, a second bonus prize was added to the board featuring four years of prepaid tuition at any four-year college or university in Ohio, along with extra cash added to make the prize worth $20,000. This was later replaced with Ohio Lottery tickets attached to a dollar amount. In all cases, like the standard Bonus card, the prize value was not added to the score, but the additional dollar amount hidden behind the bonus card was.\nThe contestant in the lead after each had three turns won the game, had their score doubled (excluding bonuses), and advanced to the Championship Game. All other contestants left the game with whatever they had won.\nIn the event of a tie for the lead after three rounds, a tiebreaker round was played. Originally, the tying contestants each picked a playing card from a set of eight, with the highest value card winning. These were later replaced by cash amounts from $100 to $800, again with the highest amount winning.\nA second semifinal Game is played with four new contestants and a new board, exactly as before.\n\n2009\u20132017\nOn October 3, 2009, the board was increased to 36 spaces and consisted of nine columns of four rows. The columns were labeled E-X-P-L-O-S-I-O-N and the rows labeled C-A-S-H. The cash amounts ranged from $1,500 to $5,000.\nThe number of special spaces increased from three to nine, with two $10,000 cash bonus squares, one $25,000 bonus square and six double squares. Every time a contestant hit a double square, as before, he or she received an extra turn. However, after finding a double card the contestant randomly stopped on one of the letters in E-X-P-L-O-S-I-O-N above the game board, revealing a dollar amount between $2,000 and $5,000, which was then doubled and added to their score. Later, a bonus prize was hidden in one of the spaces which contain the same rule as the cash bonuses.\nThe tiebreaker round had four amounts hidden behind the letters in the word \"cash\". As before, the highest score won and the contestant advanced to the Cash Challenge.\n\nChampionship Game/Cash Challenge\n1989\u20131993\nThe two semifinal winners competed against the returning champion. To begin, a target number between 10 and 17 was selected from a randomizer. The contestants then spun a wheel containing numbers from one to nine and an additional space marked \"double\", attempting to come as close to the target number without going over. If two or three contestants tied, each contestant picked a playing card from a set of eight. The contestant with the highest card won. Originally, the contestants spun three individual wheels (with a ball attached inside each wheel), one for each contestant. Later, this was changed to contestants spinning one wheel.\nA first-time champion's winnings were augmented to $50,000, while a two-time champion earned another $50,000 for a total of $100,000. A three-time champion earned another $100,000 for a total of $200,000 and retired from the show.\n\n1993\u20132017\nFrom 1993\u20132009, the three contestants' names were each hidden three times behind a game board with nine squares total. The contestants took turns selecting squares, uncovering the names behind them. The person whose name was uncovered three times first won the game and the right to return the following week, with the same payout structure for returning champions used from 1989\u20131993.\nBeginning October 3, 2009, three cash bonuses totaling $25,000 (two $10,000 spaces and one $5,000 space) were added to the championship game board which now features a total of twelve spaces. If a contestant selects a bonus space they win that amount of money and control passes to the next contestant in line. Additionally, contestants no longer retire after winning their third game. First-time champions still win a total of $50,000, two-time winners $100,000, and three-time winners $200,000 (bonuses not included). However, a champion wins an additional $100,000 for every subsequent week they win thereafter. Champions can remain on the show until defeated, with no monetary limits or maximum number of appearances, mirroring Jeopardy!'s returning champions rule. By 2012, the final round was renamed the \"Cash Challenge\". Under this format, the highest amount awarded was $520,000, which was reached by Terri Waddell on the October 20, 2012 episode, when she was defeated during her record-breaking seventh appearance on the show.\nBecause the first 2007 show did not have a returning champion (due to the final winner of Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich choosing to keep her earnings and leave), the two semifinal winners simply played against themselves, with the winner becoming the new returning champion.\nAs part of the 30th Anniversary season leading up to the XL format, bonus prizes such as vacations, laptops, and gasoline for a year are available under one square in each round.\n\nCash Explosion XL\nStarting June 3, 2017 and lasting throughout the summer, as part of the 30th Anniversary Celebration, the show modified its format and briefly renamed itself Cash Explosion XL. Under this format, 24 contestants participate in each semifinal game, in teams of three.\nEach contestant takes one turn, and all three contestants win whatever total is displayed on their podium. If a double is found, that same contestant hits the button again. If, however, the square chosen reveals a cash bonus, only the contestant who selects the square wins the bonus money. One of the co-hosts (Sharon, Cherie, or David) will bring out a silver or golden bar with the amount written on it to represent the bonus money.\nThe Cash Challenge is the same as in the regular version, but only one person from the winning team can play; the contestant is chosen via the new \"Cash Challenge Qualifier.\"\n\nCash Challenge Qualifier\nNine green squares spell out the word \"CHALLENGE,\" and each hides a number from 1 to 9. Each contestant selects one square, and the contestant with the highest number plays in the Cash Challenge. That same contestant also gets their total doubled, as winners do in the regular version.\n\nSpotlight (2017\u20132022)\nA new format debuted on September 2, 2017. The semifinal round features eight contestants playing individually. Each contestant is presented with their own grid of twenty squares, behind which are hidden various money amounts, two double tiles and one bonus tile. The contestant selects three of the twenty squares, and the values associated with each selection is revealed one at a time. Contestants are ranked by the total amount of their three selections. The two contestants with the highest totals have their banks doubled and advance to the Cash Challenge championship round.\nIf a contestant reveals a double tile, he or she then selects a letter in the word \"spotlight\", which is positioned above their game board. The value associated with the letter selected is doubled and added to the contestant's bank.\nIf a contestant reveals the bonus tile, he or she then makes a selection from the bonus board. On the board are sixteen tiles, each labeled with the name of one of the top Ohio Lottery games (including the C.E. game itself, as well as more common games such as Powerball). Hidden behind each tile is a bonus cash award worth between $10,000 and $50,000, or in earlier episodes, a $5,000 bonus attached to an instant trip to the Cash Challenge championship round. The contestant makes a selection and wins the associated bonus; however, this amount is not added to the contestant's bank in terms of scoring purposes. Also attached to each tile is a second cash award which is added to the bank.\nIn the later section, a Second Chance round is used to determine a fourth contestant in the Cash Challenge.  Each of the 6 contestants that did not make it to the top 2 gets to choose a letter from the phrase \"SECOND CHANCE\"(each letter hiding a random number from 1-12) and whoever's chosen letter has the highest number attached to it gets $5,000 added to their bank and advances to the Cash Challenge.\nThe Cash Challenge is played as before, but with a fourth contestant, with the contestant whose name is revealed three times becoming or continuing as champion; however, no more bonus money is present.\n\nC.E. Play at Home\nFrom May 2020 to August 2021, C.E. suspended tapings due to COVID-19 and allows contestants to play at home.\n\nC.E. (2022-present)\nOn October 15, 2022, the format was overhauled. This time, the eight players played one at a time, facing one large screen. The main game board now features 24 hexagon tiles: hiding money, one double tile, one triple tile, a bonus tile, an extra play tile, and an Ohio Lottery ticket jackpot (which is the Ohio Lottery logo).\nLike in Spotlight, the player selects three tiles on his/her podium. If a player finds a double or triple tile, his/her game board transforms into a multiplier board which the player selects one of nine money related terms (Coins, Bank, Purse, Safe, Cash, Gold, Diamond, Money Tree, and Piggy Bank). Whatever the amount is shown, it is doubled or tripled. If a player finds a bonus tile, he/she is shown the Ohio Lottery win station and selects one of sixteen most popular Ohio Lottery games (including the namesake C.E. itself). The Ohio Lottery win station also shows the Retailer of the Week. Once the double/triple and bonus tiles are found, the game board returns to its normal configuration. If a player finds the Ohio Lottery Ticket Jackpot, he/she wins $1,000 worth of Ohio Lottery tickets from a randomly chosen instant game (each audience member over the age of 18 also receives one of the tickets chosen for the ticket jackpot for the week). If a player finds an Extra Play, the game board adds a 4th tile and he/she can make a 4th selection on the board.\nAs usual, the two winners advance to the Cash Challenge and have their winnings doubled. The Second Chance and Cash Challenge remain the same as the previous format, but if a player has more than $40,000+ in total, they will play for $75,000 instead of $50,000.  If there is a tie for second place after the 8 contestants have played their turns, the players who are tied play the tiebreaker on a board with 9 numbers.  Each picks a number and the player whose selection has the highest hidden number goes through to the Cash Challenge and the others go to the Second Chance game.\nAt the time, the show\u2019s catchphrase \u201cGotta Get On That Show!\u201d is introduced.\n\nCancellation and return\nThe show was replaced in October 2006 with Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich. However, due to disappointing ratings for that program, the Ohio Lottery announced the show would be replaced by a new version of Cash Explosion on October 6, 2007. All remaining Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich \"ENTRY\" winners sent in within 180 days of that game's official withdrawal were also eligible for Cash Explosion's return. In that case, anyone who made it on Cash Explosion with a $2 ticket won $2,250 on top of whatever they won.\nThe champion on the last episode of Make Me Famous, Make Me Rich was offered the choice of playing as returning champion on the first episode of the new Cash Explosion, or taking an extra payout of $100,000. She chose the latter option, bringing her total to $171,350.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website"], "Ground_truth": "Cash Explosion, known as Cash Explosion Double Play from 1989 until 2012, is an official Ohio Lottery TV game show, which is broadcast on television stations throughout Ohio.

A sequel, The Widows of Eastwick, was published in 2008.\n\nPlot\nThe story, set in the fictional Rhode Island town of Eastwick in the early 1970s, follows the witches Alexandra Spofford, Jane Smart, and Sukie Rougemont, who acquire their powers after their respective marriages end. Their coven is upset by the arrival of Darryl Van Horne, who buys a neglected mansion outside of town. The mysterious Darryl seduces each of the women, encouraging their creative powers and creating a scandal in the town. The power of the three witches grows, so much so that they unknowingly bewitch the townsfolk they come in contact with. This becomes clear when Sukie's lover and boss, Clyde Gabriel, kills his busybody wife Felicia before hanging himself.\nThe three women share Darryl in relative peace until he unexpectedly marries their young, innocent friend, Jenny, the Gabriels' daughter. The witches resolve to take revenge by giving her cancer through their magic. Although Alexandra feels remorse for their hex, the spell kills Jenny and Darryl flees town with her younger brother, Chris, apparently his lover. In his wake, he leaves their relationships strained and their sense of self in doubt.  Eventually, each summons her ideal man and leaves town.\n\nLiterary significance and criticism\nUpdike described his novel as \"about female power, a power that patriarchal societies have denied.\" Many scholars viewed it as strongly pro-feminist, \"an intelligent engagement with feminism, and a rare case of a male novelist writing from women's points of view.\"  Some have expressed concern that the book may be misogynistic, as it seems to reinforce the patriarchal conceptions of women as witches and of women requiring a man for personal growth; others believe that the book may be more of a satire of such ideas.\nAt the same time, there were those who praised the novel as a departure from Updike's previous novels.\n\nIn other media\nFilm\nIn 1987, the novel was adapted into a film starring Jack Nicholson as Darryl, Cher as Alexandra, Susan Sarandon as Jane, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Sukie \u2013 with considerable differences from the book's plot. The film's Oscar-nominated score was composed by John Williams.\n\nTelevision\nIn 1992, a television series pilot aired that was directed by Rick Rosenthal and starred Michael Siberry as Darryl, Ally Walker as Alexandra, Julia Campbell as Jane, and Catherine Mary Stewart as Sukie. It was not picked up as a series.\nIn 2002, a television series pilot was filmed based on the world created in the book, called simply Eastwick.  It starred Jason O'Mara as Darryl, Marcia Cross as Jane, Kelly Rutherford as Alexandra, and Lori Loughlin as Sukie.  It was not picked up as a series so only the pilot episode exists.\nIn 2009, The Witches of Eastwick was adapted into a television series on ABC, this one entitled Eastwick, with Lindsay Price, Jaime Ray Newman and Rebecca Romijn as the three witches. Paul Gross played Darryl. Veronica Cartwright who had played Felicia Alden in the 1987 movie is also in the cast of the series as Bun Waverly. The show was cancelled during its first season.\n\nMusical\n\nIn 2000, the novel was adapted into a stage musical by John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe, originally staged in London.\nIn 2002, The Witches of Eastwick musical opened in Australia, starring Paul McDermott as Darryl Van Horne, Marina Prior as Jane Smart, Pippa Grandison as Sukie Rougemont and Angela Toohey as Alexandra Spofford.\nIn 2007, the stage musical had its American debut at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n\n== References =="], "Ground_truth": "The movie The Witches of Eastwick was filmed in various locations.
